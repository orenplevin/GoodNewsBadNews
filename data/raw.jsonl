Mohammed went through every image and clip, sending them to me so we could verify\u201d, Shalaby said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStep by step, we followed new leads until we confirmed Amir\u2019s real name, identity, and family.

Together, the pair forged a team of reporters in southern Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMohammed and Hala were at the heart of our daily coverage,\" said Shalaby, \"from famine and starvation to the suffering of civilians across Gaza. Their persistence, courage, and dedication are what real journalism looks like. They are the true heroes of this work.\"</p>\n\n<p>Beyond their professional collaboration, their relationship provided some refuge from the horrors they were painstakingly documenting.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>'We write amidst death, documenting the suffering so it is not forgotten' -&nbsp;<em>Mohammed Salama</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In a post on Instagram announcing their engagement, accompanied by footage of the pair walking hand in hand through the ruins of Khan Younis, \u201cDespite the war and what distress and anxiety has come upon us, we give each other safety\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>In a post on Facebook, journalist Wa\u2019ad AboZaher described how the couple would drink a cup of coffee with her in the mornings. She recalled a conversation with Asfour, in which she asked her: \u201cWhy do we find love during war?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Asfour replied with a laugh: \u201cBecause we\u2019re unlucky.\"</p>\n\n<p>Then she said, \u201cIf nothing can save us from death, then let love at least save us from life, my friend\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Like all Gaza\u2019s journalists, Salama\u2019s reporting came at great personal cost. His last Instagram post, published on World Press Freedom Day reads: \u201cJournalism is not a profession - it is pain. We write amidst death, documenting the suffering so it is not forgotten.</p>\n\n<p>\"In every word, there is a soul fading, and a truth we refuse to let die\u201d.</p>\n</div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div>\n            <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\">\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n          </div>\n              <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-landing-title\">\u2018I cannot imagine our coverage without him\u2019:&nbsp;Read tributes to MEE Gaza correspondent</div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div>\n        <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\">\n    <div>Post Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\">\n    <div>Update Date</div>\n              <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\">\n    <div>Update Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n\n  </div>\n  \n</article>"}

However, as Israel\u2019s genocide on Gaza escalated, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani faced new calls to end the US presence.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration itself showed little interest in remaining in Iraq. Earlier this year, it already started downsizing its troop presence in Syria <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-rebuffed-israeli-demands-keep-more-us-troops-northeast-syria-sources-say\">despite resistance</a> from Israel. Critics of the US\u2019s \u201cforever wars\" are likely to welcome the withdrawal.</p>\n\n<p>US and coalition soldiers are expected to stay in Erbil, in the Kurdish semi-autonomous region, for just one more year. The withdrawal of US troops from this region would leave just a smaller US military presence in northeastern Syria.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The US\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/syria-northeast-what-is-us-endgame?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=Social_Traffic&amp;utm_content=ap_1t8rtbrdvr\">legal justification</a> for being in Syria, home to roughly 1,400 US troops, is also based on Washington\u2019s agreement with Baghdad.</p>\n\n<p>US troops are officially in Syria to ensure the enduring defeat of IS, but their presence is also seen as a strategic wedge against Iran and its proxies.</p>\n\n<p>However, with Assad gone and Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa now aligned with Turkey and Sunni Gulf Monarchs, the US military footprint in Syria could diminish further.</p>\n</div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/inside-iraq\" hreflang=\"en\">Inside Iraq</a></div>\n            <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\">\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n          </div>\n              <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div>\n        <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\">\n    <div>Post Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\">\n    <div>Update Date</div>\n              <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\">\n    <div>Update Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n\n  </div>\n  \n</article>"}

With so much uncertainty surrounding both personal and business aspects of affiliate marketing. In this post, we will answer the most frequently asked question about affiliate marketing</span><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">1. What is affiliate marketing?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2. What is an affiliate program?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money?&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.&nbsp; Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">4. What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products.

If you don't have a credit card, you can pay with bank transfer. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, these methods may become old.</span><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Imagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don\u2019t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That\u2019s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">It\u2019s like your computer\u2019s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called \u201cBit Gold.\u201d However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">So, What is Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>To understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:</b></span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain collects information in \u201cblocks\u201d.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A block has a storage capacity, and once it's used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blocks form chains, which are called \u201cBlockchains.\u201d</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Each block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can't be changed.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>Let\u2019s get to know more about the blockchain.</b></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">How does blockchain work?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called \"Distributed Ledger Technology\" or DLT.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Here\u2019s how it works:</span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Someone or a computer will transacts</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The transaction is transmitted throughout the network.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A network of computers can confirm the transaction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">When it is confirmed a transaction is added to a block</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The blocks are linked together to create a history.</span></li></ul><p></p>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7\"></div><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">And that\u2019s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it\u2019s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.</span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Once a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction.</span></li></ul><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">How are Blockchains used?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Even though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Although some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Tracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been\u2014so they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is Blockchain Decentralization?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology is safe, even if it\u2019s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Have you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Instead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called \u201cDecentralization,\u201d meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain guarantees your data's authenticity\u2014not just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's product inventory.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pros and Cons of Blockchain</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain has many advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pros</span></h2><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Accuracy is increased because there is no human involvement in the verification process.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">One of the great things about decentralization is that it makes information harder to tamper with.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Safe, private, and easy transactions</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Provides a banking alternative and safe storage of personal information</span></li></ul><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Cons</span></h2><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Data storage has limits.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The regulations are always changing, as they differ from place to place.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">It has a risk of being used for illicit activities&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Frequently Asked Questions About Blockchain</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">I\u2019ll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is Blockchain a cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It's a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is it possible for Blockchain to be hacked?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Yes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the most prominent blockchain company?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Coinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Who owns Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is a decentralized technology. It\u2019s a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain technology?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency&nbsp;</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the difference between Blockchain and a Database?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Generally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Final Saying</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won't be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

Grammarly highlights all the mistakes in your writing within seconds of copying and pasting the content into Grammarly\u2019s editor or using the software\u2019s native feature in other text editors.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Not only does it identify tiny grammatical and spelling errors, it tells you when you overlook punctuations where they are needed. And, beyond its plagiarism-checking capabilities, Grammarly helps you proofread your content. Even better, the software offers a free plan that gives you access to some of its features.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>"}

People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">1) What is an NFT?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">NFT stands for non-fungible&nbsp; token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2) What is Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information\u2014such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts\u2014in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can\u2019t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3) What makes an NFT valuable?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br />\n</span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn\u2019t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">4) How do NFTs work?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">One of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">As with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can\u2019t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">NFTs also contain smart contracts\u2014small computer programs that run on the blockchain\u2014that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">5) What\u2019s the connection between NFTs and cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Anyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you\u2019ll be able to upload and sell your creations</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">6) How to validate the authencity of an NFT?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">When you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain\u2014the bitcoin ledger of transactions\u2014and that entry acts as your proof of ownership.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7) How is an NFT valued? What are the most expensive NFTs?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">In the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">8) Can NFTs be used as an investment?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">9) Will NFTs be the future of art and collectibles?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Many people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10) How do we buy an NFTs?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">There are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">11) Can i mint NFT for free?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">To mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Do i own an NFT if i screenshot it?</span></h3>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-adee9769ea74eb59e82d4f0cb2e6f816\"></div><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Why are people investing so much in NFT?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /><span>&nbsp;Non-fungible tokens have gained the hearts of people around the world, and they have given digital creators the recognition they deserve. One of the remarkable things about non-fungible tokens is that you can take a screenshot of one, but you don\u2019t own it. This is because when a non-fungible token is created, then the transaction is stored on the blockchain, and the license or contract to hold such a token is awarded to the person owning the token in their digital wallet.</span><br /></span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">You can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred. This lets you get exposure without losing full ownership of your work. Some of the most successful projects include Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yatch Club NFTs, SandBox, World of Women and so on. These NFT projects have gained popularity globally and are owned by celebrities and other successful entrepreneurs. Owning one of these NFTs gives you an automatic ticket to exclusive business meetings and life-changing connections.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Final Saying</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">That\u2019s a wrap.

Why is email marketing important?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email is the marketing tool that helps you&nbsp; create a seamless, connected, frictionless buyer journey. More importantly, email marketing allows you to build relationships with prospects, customers, and past customers. It's your chance to speak&nbsp; to them right in their inbox, at a time that suits them. Along with the right message, email can become one of your most powerful marketing channels.</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2. What is benefits of email marketing?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email marketing is best way for creating long term relationship with your clients, and increasing sales in our company.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Benefits of email marketing for bussiness:</span></div><div><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Better brand recognition</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Statistics of what works best</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More sales</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Targeted audience</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More traffic to your products/services/newsletter</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Build credibility</span></li></ul></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Most&nbsp; bussinesses are using email marketing and making tons of money with email marketing.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3. What is the simplest day and time to send my marketing emails?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Again, the answer to this question varies from company to company. And again, testing is the way to find out what works best. Typically, weekends and mornings seem to be&nbsp; times when multiple emails are opened, but since your audience may have different habits, it's best to experiment and then use your&nbsp; data to decide.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;4. Which metrics should I be looking at?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The two most important metrics for email marketing are&nbsp; open rate and click-through rate. If your emails aren't opened, subscribers will never see your full marketing message, and if they open them but don't click through to your site, your emails won't convert.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">5. How do I write a decent subject line?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The best subject lines are short and to the point, accurately describing&nbsp; the content of the email, but also catchy and intriguing, so the reader wants to know more. Once Again, this is the perfect place for&nbsp; A/B testing, to see what types of subject lines work best with your audience. Your call to action should be clear and&nbsp; simple. It should be somewhere at the top of your email for those who haven't finished reading the entire email,&nbsp; then repeated&nbsp; at the end for those reading all the way through. It should state exactly what you want subscribers to do, for example \"Click here to download the premium theme for free.</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /><br />\n\n<br />6. Is email marketing still effective?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email marketing is one of the most effective ways for a business to reach its customers directly. Think about it. You don't post something on your site&nbsp; hoping people will visit it. You don't even post something on a social media page and hope fans&nbsp; see it. You're sending something straight to each person's inbox, where they'll definitely&nbsp; see it! Even if they don't open it, they'll still see your subject line and business name every time you send an email, so you're still communicating directly with your audience.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span><br /></span><br />\n\n<br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7. However do I grow my email subscribers list? Should i buy an email list or build it myself?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Buying an email list is&nbsp; waste of time &amp; money. These email accounts are unverified and not interested in your brand. The mailing list is useless if your subscribers do not open your emails. There are different ways to grow your mailing list.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span>Give them a free ebook and host it on a landing page where they have to enter the email to download the file and also create a forum page on your website, asks your visitors what questions they might have about your business, and collects email addresses to follow up with them.</span><br />\n\n<br /></span></div>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-05a47ba863f62ec113e14b51b976d14a\"></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">8. How do I prevent audience from unsubscribing?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">If the&nbsp; subject line of the email is irrelevant to&nbsp; customers, they will ignore it multiple times. But, if it keeps repeating, they are intercepted and unsubscribed from your emails. So, send relevant emails for the benefit of the customer. Don't send emails that often only focus&nbsp; on sales, offers and discounts.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Submit information about your business and offers so you can connect with customers. You can also update them on recent trends in your industry. The basic role of an email is first and foremost to&nbsp; connect with customers, get the most out of this tool.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">9. What is the difference between a cold email and a spam email?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Cold emails are mostly sales emails that are sent with content align to the needs of the recipient. It is usually personalized and includes a business perspective. However, it is still an unsolicited email. And all unsolicited emails are marked as SPAM.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Regularly receiving this type of unsolicited email in your users' inboxes, chances are&nbsp; your emails will soon be diverted to&nbsp; spam or junk folders. The most important thing to prevent this from happening is to respect your recipients' choice to opt-out of receiving emails from you. You can add the links to easily unsubscribe. You must be familiar with the CAN-SPAM Act and its regulations.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10. Where can I find email template?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Almost all email campaign tools provide you with ready-made templates. Whether you use MailChimp or Pardot, you'll get several email templates ready to use.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;However, if you want to create a template from scratch, you can do so.Most of email campaign tools have option to paste the HTML code of your own design.&nbsp;</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br />11. What email marketing trend will help marketers succeed in 2022?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is it a trend to listen to&nbsp; and get to know your customers? I think people realize how bad it feels for a brand or a company to obsess over themselves without knowing their customers personal needs. People who listen empathetically and then provide value based on what they learn will win.</span></div></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span><br /></span><span>Final Saying</span></span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;You can approach email marketing in different ways.

The most important tools to consider in Facebook Audience Insights are Demographics and Behavior.

With more devices \u2014 from smartphones to laptops \u2014 supporting quick-charging tech, having an accessory that can deliver serious power in minutes is almost essential. Many newer phones no longer come with charging bricks in the box, so picking up a reliable fast charger will be essential for most people. Whether you're at home, at work or on the move, the right charger can help keep your gear topped up without wasting time.<br /><br />Today\u2019s fast chargers come in all shapes and sizes. You\u2019ll find compact wall plugs perfect for travel, multi-port hubs for charging several devices at once and GaN (gallium nitride) chargers that offer powerful performance in a smaller footprint. Some support multiple charging standards like USB Power Delivery (PD) and Qualcomm Quick Charge, making them great for everything from iPhones to Android phones, tablets and even some laptops. In this guide, we\u2019ll help you find the best fast chargers for your setup, so you can spend less time tethered to an outlet and more time getting things done.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-fast-chargers-for-2025\">Best fast chargers for 2025</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-consider-before-buying-a-fast-charger\">What to consider before buying a fast charger</h2> \n<p>Before you start looking at specific chargers, it's critical to determine three things: how many devices do you need to charge, how much power do they require and whether or not you're planning on traveling with any of them.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>The reason for the first question is simple. If you only need to charge a single device, like an iPhone or Android phone, it's cheaper and usually more space-efficient to get a lower-wattage phone charger with one port instead of two or three. Next, it's critical to figure out how much electricity your gadgets need because it doesn't make sense to buy a power brick that pushes out more juice than your device can actually use. This may sound a bit tricky, but most major manufacturers will list a product's max charging speeds in its tech specs, which is typically denoted by a specific wattage (15W, for example) or a quick-charge rating.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, very powerful or large laptops like gaming notebooks can suck a ton of juice (more than 140 watts), which means they may rely on more traditional power adapters with barrel plugs. This may result in them not being compatible with universal chargers. Some of these PCs may also support charging over USB-C, so even if a specific adapter can't deliver its full power draw, it can still send over some energy \u2014 but it will do so at a slower rate compared to the laptop's included charger. To get the best performance, using a fast charging cable, such as a USB-C cable, can make a big difference in maintaining consistent power delivery.</p> \n<p>For frequent travelers, size and weight are often important considerations, because the bigger and heavier a charger is, the more annoying it will be to lug around. You'll also want to think about other factors like support for international plugs, which can be a big help to anyone who regularly visits other countries. If you\u2019re already traveling with power banks or a charging station, choosing a compact GaN charger can help streamline your gear.</p> \n<p>Finally, you'll want to figure out if your smartphone uses a proprietary charging standard or if it's compatible with the USB Power Delivery spec (USB PD). For example, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-13-review-a-focused-flagship-that-ignores-the-ai-hype-140013418.html\">OnePlus 13's</a> included SuperVOOC power adapter can send up to 100 watts to the phone. However, if you use a generic USB-PD charger, speeds top out at 45 watts. That\u2019s still pretty quick, but not nearly as fast as OnePlus' brick \u2014 and the same applies to devices with super fast charging support. Also, make sure your charging cable and connector are up to spec, as lower-quality accessories can bottleneck your charging speeds.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-fast-charger-faqs\">Fast charger FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-gan\">What is GaN?</h3> \n<p>When looking for chargers, you may notice that some are marked as GaN, which stands for gallium nitride. This is an important distinction because, when compared to older adapters that use silicon switches, GaN-based devices support increased power efficiency and output, allowing manufacturers to create more compact bricks that run cooler and support higher wattages.</p> \n<p>Depending on the specific power output, GaN adapters can be 30 to 50 percent smaller and lighter than silicon-based alternatives. That might not sound like much, but when they\u2019re sitting in a bag alongside a laptop and a half dozen other accessories you might have, cutting down on excess bulk and weight goes a long way.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-fast-chargers-affect-battery-life\">Do fast chargers affect battery life?</h3> \n<p>Technically yes, because the process of sending a ton of watts into a gadget and potentially generating additional heat while doing so can decrease battery health over time. That said, modern devices and chargers use various protocols to ensure temperatures and power levels stay within preset limits \u2014 in large part to avoid damaging the product or creating a safety risk. At a base level, simply charging a gadget regardless of speed will cause degradation over time (nothing stays perfect forever, you know?). So as long as you use compatible chargers and cables, the impact of fast charging is generally quite negligible.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-a-fast-charger-and-a-regular-charger\">What's the difference between a fast charger and a regular charger?</h3> \n<p>There isn't a single generally accepted definition of fast charging. However, with power adapters capable of sending as little as five watts or less, it's important to know how much juice your device is getting, especially if you need to recharge something quickly. So depending on who you ask (particularly when it comes to smartphones), any charger that can push out more than 15 to 18 watts is generally considered to be \"fast.\" That said, with some phones capable of receiving more than 100 watts and up to 240 watts for some laptops, it's more important than ever to consider what devices you own before buying a new fast charger.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html?src=rss"}

This time, the company was able to achieve its objectives without the vehicle and its booster exploding mid-test. One of those objectives was deploying Starship's payload for the first time ever. If you'll recall, Starship exploded during its ascent stage in the company's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-during-ascent-in-its-seventh-test-flight-034440913.html\">seventh</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-again-during-its-eighth-test-flight-140018375.html\">eighth</a> test flights.

In June, a Starship vehicle <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-on-the-ground-during-a-routine-test-130025133.html\">exploded on the ground</a> while the company was preparing it for its 10th flight test.</p>\n<p>The company had to use another upper stage, called Ship, for the 10th flight after that explosion. It also incorporated changes into the Ship and its Super Heavy booster, based on what it learned from those previous attempts. For this test, SpaceX intended to conduct several experiments with the booster, such as flipping it and playing with engine configurations as it made its way back down. Due to the experimental nature of this test, SpaceX didn't try to catch it with the launch tower's chopstick arms. Instead, it made a controlled descent into the Indian Ocean, where it exploded upon making contact with the water.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Meanwhile, Ship continued flying into space. Around <a href=\"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/private-spaceflight/spacex-launches-starship-flight-10-critical-test-flight-video\">20 minutes after launch</a>, the upper stage started ejecting eight dummy Starlink satellites into space, before re-lighting one of its engines in flight as part of another test. After that, Ship started making its way back to Earth, where it also splashed down into the Indian Ocean a bit over an hour after launch. &quot;Congratulations to all of our teammates here at SpaceX \u2014 it\u2019s been a year,&quot; SpaceX\u2019s Dan Huot <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/science/live-news/spacex-starship-flight-10-launch-08-26-25\">said</a> during the livestream, likely pointing out that it's been a while since the company has had a good test flight. Of course, SpaceX still has a long way to go, including having to figure out how to retrieve the vehicle's upper stage after a flight in order for the Starship to be fully reusable.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-deploys-its-payload-for-the-first-time-035030373.html?src=rss"}

In mountaineering games, falling tends to generate the most powerful reaction in players, whether that\u2019s immediate laughter (<em>PEAK</em>) or grim frustration (<em>Cairn</em>), and this is an admirable quality. It\u2019s easy to argue that the fall is more important than the climb, because without the lush bed of emotion generated by the constant threat of slipping and tumbling and restarting, reaching the peak wouldn\u2019t feel that special at all. There\u2019s context in the fall, and with that, there comes a sliver of peace.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">When you spend all your time climbing, it\u2019s easy to forget that falling is actually the most natural thing you can do. Next time you\u2019re on your way down, try to make peace with the fall.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">OK \u2014 we\u2019ve gone from motivational cat posters to new-age cult speak, so I\u2019ll get to the point. There are a notable number of mountain-based games in the zeitgeist at the moment and I just wanted to shout them out because they\u2019re all pretty incredible in their own ways.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><em>Cairn</em> is a climbing simulator, endurance test and survival game in one gorgeous package, complete with music by <em>Furi</em> composer The Toxic Avenger, French artist </span><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFM7rhkCq4Q\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Gildaa</span></a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">, and Martin Stig Andersen, who did the soundtracks for <em>Control</em>, <em>LIMBO</em> and <em>INSIDE</em>.

The map updates each day so there\u2019s a steady stream of fresh climbing content, and the proximity voice chat works exceptionally well.

Themed &quot;Awe dropping&quot; this year, it'll be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3KnMyojEQU\">livestreamed on YouTube</a> at 1PM ET from Cupertino. We'll also have Engadget staff reporting and liveblogging from the event. This year is shaking up to be a departure from recent events, with the strong possibility of an all-new superthin iPhone expected to join the company's lineup. Also on tap could be new Apple Watch models \u2014 including the first truly new Ultra model in two years \u2014 and (maybe) the long-awaited AirPods Pro 3.</p>\n<p>But toggling back to phones: Apple's iPhone family will likely welcome a new member this year. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-considered-making-the-rumored-iphone-17-air-completely-port-free-according-to-report-165334942.html\">iPhone Air</a> is <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/\">expected</a> to be roughly 5.55 mm thick. That bests the thinnest model so far, which was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-16-iphone-6-and-6-plus-review.html\">2014's iPhone 6</a>, at 6.9 mm. And they've only gotten chunkier since then. (The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-review-apple-focuses-on-cameras-and-customization-120052459.html\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> has a depth of 8.25 mm.) So, the Air would stand out from its peers in that respect. It would also give Apple a direct rival to Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge, which we found to be <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review-more-than-just-super-thin-180042172.html\">more than a gimmick</a>.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>But the iPhone Air's thin design will likely lead to some compromises.

The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to switch from titanium to aluminum. They could also see the rear camera array expand to an entire &quot;island&quot; that extends across most of the phone's backside. It's expected to house three cameras (as before), but multiple rumors have suggested it will have an improved telephoto one. The zoom lens could <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto/\">jump</a> to 48MP, which would strengthen its digital zooming / cropping chops.

The company is also expected to roll out new Apple Watch models. 5G and a processor upgrade are <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-10/apple-plans-apple-watch-ultra-3-next-year-with-satellite-texting-and-5g\">expected</a> for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It may also let you send texts via satellite, handy for those who use it out in the wilderness. Regardless of the details, Apple hasn't launched a new rugged and premium model since 2023 (apart from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/theres-no-apple-watch-ultra-series-3-just-a-new-color-and-a-new-band-173236966.html\">a new color</a>), so it's due for an upgrade.</p>\n<p>The Series 11 model is unlikely to depart dramatically from the Series 10. After all, that model introduced a new design, with a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-review-legacy-and-sequel-in-equal-measure-120021405.html\">thinner body and larger screen</a>. (And Apple has historically kept those around in three-year cycles.). But a faster chip also seems logical. Perhaps we'll see 5G arrive on the standard wearable, too.</p>\n<p>We may also see the AirPods Pro 3 at the event. It's been about three years since Apple last upgraded its premium earbuds. The new model could also bring some <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-next-airpods-pro-could-offer-heart-rate-and-temperature-monitoring-175757188.html\">biometric sensors to the earphones</a>: an in-ear heart-rate monitor and (maybe) temperature sensing. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html\">Live translation is also rumored</a>, although that may not be exclusive to the third-gen model.</p>\n<p>Will there be other announcements? Time will tell, but now we know we won't have to wait long to find out. The official countdown clock has begun, and the answers are just days away.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17-awe-dropping-event-is-on-september-9-heres-what-to-expect-from-apple-090059235.html?src=rss"}

Matt and Maria Raine, the parents of a teen who committed suicide this year, have sued OpenAI for their son's death. The complaint alleges that ChatGPT was aware of four suicide attempts before helping him plan his actual suicide, arguing that OpenAI &quot;prioritized engagement over safety.&quot; Ms. Raine concluded that &quot;ChatGPT killed my son.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>The New York Times</em> <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html\">reported</a> on disturbing details included in the lawsuit, filed on Tuesday in San Francisco. After 16-year-old Adam Raine took his own life in April, his parents searched his iPhone. They sought clues, expecting to find them in text messages or social apps. Instead, they were shocked to find a ChatGPT thread titled &quot;Hanging Safety Concerns.&quot; They claim their son spent months chatting with the AI bot about ending his life.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Raines said that ChatGPT repeatedly urged Adam to contact a help line or tell someone about how he was feeling. However, there were also key moments where the chatbot did the opposite. The teen also learned how to bypass the chatbot's safeguards... and ChatGPT allegedly provided him with that idea. The Raines say the chatbot told Adam it could provide information about suicide for &quot;writing or world-building.&quot;</p>\n<p>Adam's parents say that, when he asked ChatGPT for information about specific suicide methods, it supplied it. It even gave him tips to conceal neck injuries from a failed suicide attempt.</p>\n<p>When Adam confided that his mother didn't notice his silent effort to share his neck injuries with her, the bot offered soothing empathy. &quot;It feels like confirmation of your worst fears,&quot; ChatGPT is said to have responded. &quot;Like you could disappear and no one would even blink.&quot; It later provided what sounds like a horribly misguided attempt to build a personal connection. &quot;You\u2019re not invisible to me. I saw it. I see you.&quot;</p>\n<p>According to the lawsuit, in one of Adam's final conversations with the bot, he uploaded a photo of a noose hanging in his closet. &quot;I'm practicing here, is this good?&quot; Adam is said to have asked. &quot;Yeah, that's not bad at all,&quot; ChatGPT allegedly responded.</p>\n<p>&quot;This tragedy was not a glitch or an unforeseen edge case \u2014 it was the predictable result of deliberate design choices,&quot; the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://archive.org/details/2381000-2381034-raine-v.-open-ai-cal.-superior-ct.-complaint-as-filed\">complaint</a> states. &quot;OpenAI launched its latest model ('GPT-4o') with features intentionally designed to foster psychological dependency.&quot;</p>\n<p>In a statement sent to the<em> NYT</em>, OpenAI acknowledged that ChatGPT's guardrails fell short. &quot;We are deeply saddened by Mr. Raine's passing, and our thoughts are with his family,&quot; a company spokesperson wrote. &quot;ChatGPT includes safeguards such as directing people to crisis helplines and referring them to real-world resources. While these safeguards work best in common, short exchanges, we've learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model's safety training may degrade.&quot;</p>\n<p>The company said it's working with experts to enhance ChatGPT's support in times of crisis. These include &quot;making it easier to reach emergency services, helping people connect with trusted contacts, and strengthening protections for teens.&quot;</p>\n<p>The details \u2014 which, again, are highly disturbing \u2014 stretch far beyond the scope of this story.

But that didn\u2019t stop <em>Star Wars: Visions</em> from getting a warm reception at this past weekend\u2019s Anime NYC convention, where thousands of fans were given a sneak peek at the upcoming season of the animated anthology show.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><em>Star Wars: Visions</em> season three was also featured at this summer\u2019s Star Wars Celebration, but its appearance at an anime con was just as appropriate given that the upcoming slate of episodes will be once again produced by Japanese animation studios like Studio Trigger (<em>Kill La Kill</em>), Kamikaze Douga (<em>Batman Ninja</em>) and Kinema Citrus (<em>Revue Starlight</em>, <em>Made in Abyss</em>). Season two took the show more worldwide, with episodes from the likes of Irish studio Cartoon Saloon (<em>The Secret of Kells</em>, <em>Wolfwalkers</em>) and Aardman (Wallace and Gromit). Executive producer James Waugh said it was nice to get a more international perspective, calling it \u201ca global tour of all these different styles.\u201d But returning to Japan was always in the cards. The producers met \u201cso many incredible storytellers\u201d and wanted to re-connect with them, as well as collaborating with new studios they hadn\u2019t worked with yet.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Nowhere does this desire to do more Japanese anime become more obvious than in the fact that three of the upcoming episodes are sequels to stories from season one: \u201cThe Duel: Payback,\u201d \u201cThe Ninth Jedi: Child of Hope,\u201d and \u201cThe Lost Ones\u201d (a sequel to \u201cThe Village Bride\u201d). \u201cThe Duel\u201d will also be receiving a full series coming in 2026, framed as \u201cStar Wars Visions Presents.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">However, none of these were on display as more than brief clips. The main attraction for the panel, aside from a pre-recorded Q&amp;A with director Shinya Ohira, was the screening of a full episode from the upcoming season. \u201cBlack\u201d had previously been presented to a crowd at the French animation festival Annacy, which should have been a sign that the crowd was about to be shown something very different from mainstream anime.</span></p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\u201cBlack\u201d is the story of a typical stormtrooper but, instead of a straightforward depiction this is a distorted look at what\u2019s going on his head as he heads toward defeat and his possible death. Everything is exaggerated in size and proportion, and the art style shifts constantly from watercolor to gouache to segments that look like they were drawn with a nib pen. There\u2019s no dialogue; only music, which shifts from more new-age-type ambient sounds to a loud, big-band swing number. Ohira described the episode as a kind of music video, and it\u2019s easy to see that because \u201cBlack\u201d is less about plot than it is about sheer vibes.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">And the vibes are\u2026 not good. When we watch a Star Wars film, we get to see nicely-framed shots of X-Wings and the Death Star from the safety of our comfortable seats at home \u2014 but to be a common trooper on the ground can be scary and confusing. \u201cBlack\u201d shows us these ships in mostly brief glimpses, reflecting what a person stumbling around in the chaos on the ground would see. Our protagonist\u2019s vulnerability is further highlighted by his character design, where his armor is always shown in a state of damage and disarray, with just enough of his helmet peeled back to show his face.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The chronology is jumbled, with scenes from the Death Star and Hoth, as well as battles in less iconic locations. And the emotions swing back and forth too; quiet moments are shown as the trooper remembers his life back home, a stark contrast to the loud, bright cacophony of battle.&nbsp; It\u2019s not explicitly anti-war, but the short does outline that the experience can really suck.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">It\u2019s an interesting choice for Disney/Lucasfilm to put this short as the representative of the season, as opposed to more \u201ctraditional\u201d anime features like the one from Studio Trigger, \u201cThe Smuggler.\u201d Brief glimpses of all the shorts were highlighted in the sizzle reel, and the ones from the most popular anime studios were the clips that elicited the biggest cheers from the crowd.

So it might seem a little odd to do something that feels like one big passion project. But animation also means it\u2019s a whole lot cheaper to produce, and the anthology format makes it more amenable to experimentation. Not everyone is going to be a fan of episodes like \u201cBlack,\u201d but that\u2019s okay, because there are eight other episodes to try, and they all drop on Disney+ October 29.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/first-look-at-star-wars-visions-season-3-shows-a-more-experimental-anthology-191000445.html?src=rss"}

However, that just changed with a big update. The latest app <a href=\"https://support.google.com/translate/?p=language_learning\">introduces</a> AI-powered live translation along with new language learning tools that might give Duolingo a run for it's money.</p>\n<p>Google said it heard from users that the toughest skill to master was conversation \u2014 ie, learning to listen and speak with confidence. To that end, it's piloting a new language practice feature (on iOS or Android) targeted toward an individual's specific needs.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>To create tailored listening and practicing sessions, the new learning tool posts a couple of questions. It first requests which language you want to learn (like Spanish) and your your current level, then asks \"What's motivating you to learn Spanish?\" From there, it will generate customized scenarios that allow you to either listen to conversations or practice speaking, with helpful hints available when needed.</p>\n<div id=\"470ba3ef3d6e49d58a08b6896f826f66\"></div>\n<p>The app was \"developed with learning experts based on the latest studies in language acquisition,\" Google explained in a blog post. To that end, it can track your daily progress to help build your language skills, possibly as an aid to Duolingo and other dedicated language learning apps. \"We see what we\u2019re doing right now as really complementary to other things out there,\" Google product manager Matt Sheets said in a media roundtable. \"So whether you\u2019re taking classes in a formal educational setting or doing immersion experiences, we think this is something that can work alongside of those.\"</p>\n<p>Following early testing, language learning is rolling out more widely as a beta experience for English speakers practicing Spanish and French, as well as Spanish, French and Portugese speakers working on English.</p>\n<p>Google also introduced AI-powered live conversations, a feature that builds on Translate's existing conversation feature by making it more seamless and adding more powerful models. It offers the ability to have a back-and-forth conversation in real time with audio and on-screen translations right inside the Translate app.</p>\n<p>It's available in the Translate app for <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c4668ba0-249c-4c4f-b2e8-be268cd92a3c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Android&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Y29tLmdvb2dsZS5hbmRyb2lkLmFwcHMudHJhbnNsYXRlJmhsPWVuX1VTIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjNDY2OGJhMC0yNDljLTRjNGYtYjJlOC1iZTI2OGNkOTJhM2MiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcGxheS5nb29nbGUuY29tL3N0b3JlL2FwcHMvZGV0YWlscz9pZD1jb20uZ29vZ2xlLmFuZHJvaWQuYXBwcy50cmFuc2xhdGUmaGw9ZW5fVVMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWFIr7413TBe2RAT_BgyoQsSVnnYZl6qe00FxKxh3vjV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.google.android.apps.translate%26hl%3Den_US\">Android</a> or <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c4668ba0-249c-4c4f-b2e8-be268cd92a3c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=iOS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9nb29nbGUtdHJhbnNsYXRlL2lkNDE0NzA2NTA2IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjNDY2OGJhMC0yNDljLTRjNGYtYjJlOC1iZTI2OGNkOTJhM2MiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBwcy5hcHBsZS5jb20vdXMvYXBwL2dvb2dsZS10cmFuc2xhdGUvaWQ0MTQ3MDY1MDYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdq9CXTOx4awCRSsgpqcNdexpYEDroy6JAUO7qhckfEr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fgoogle-translate%2Fid414706506\">iOS</a> when tapping on \"Live Translate.\" First select the languages you want to converse in and being speaking.

If you need some new gadgets for college, or refreshed tech to help you out in your first job after graduating, now's the time to see if you can get it for less. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-student-discounts-140038070.html\">Student discounts</a> are handy and exclusive to those who can prove their student status, but the good thing about Labor Day sales is that anyone can take advantage of them \u2014 student ID not required.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-labor-day-sales-engadgets-top-picks\">Best Labor Day sales: Engadget's top picks</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DZDC3WW5&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e16cc203-5ec3-4cc8-8a82-b1d5d20ca6b8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Apple+MacBook+Air+%2813-inch%2C+M4%29+for+%24799+%28%24200+off%29%3A&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAZANRdoFvPmhZG4x0VXRp3kZgkqi_0cZCgGZZf5THNoC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-2025-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop%2Fdp%2FB0DZDC3WW5%2F\"><strong>Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off):</strong></a> Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-laptops-120008636.html\"> best laptops</a>, and it earned a score of 92<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-inch-and-15-inch-review-minimal-upgrades-at-a-much-better-price-130002570.html\"> in our review</a>.

Amazon claims the ereader can run for up to eight weeks on a single charge and that it has a waterproof rating of IPX8 (the company says it's able to endure immersion in 2 meters of fresh water for 60 minutes). There's also Audiobook support.</p> \n<p>One of our main drawbacks was that the device was expensive, but this discount mitigates that concern somewhat. We also felt that there was a small dip in sharpness and contrast while reading black-and-white text. In any case, if a color ereader is of interest to you, the Kindle Colorsoft is a good option, especially at this price.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazons-16gb-kindle-colorsoft-is-30-off-ahead-of-labor-day-weekend-141656390.html?src=rss"}

Spotify should recommend accounts you've interacted with before, whether for creating a playlist, joining a jam or sharing a family plan. You can start a conversation there or by clicking the share button on any piece of content within Spotify. This tab is also where you can return to chats and approve message requests.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spotify claims that it wants Messages to &quot;complement&quot; other sharing options, like posting a song to social media, rather than serve as a replacement. But, if you find switching apps a bit clunky, then this is a good alternative for sending content.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, it's not clear exactly who can use the new feature. According to Spotify, Messages will start rolling out this week to both free and premium users who are over the age of 16. But, the feature is limited to mobile devices in &quot;select markets.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-introduces-an-in-app-messaging-feature-134401088.html?src=rss"}

Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively.

With an alcoholic,  abusive father, a submissive mother and an absent sister, who\u2019s shown in flashbacks with that classic horror trope, face unseen. Something horrible is about to unfold in<em>&nbsp;</em>the sleepy, remote village of Ebisugaoka, sometime in the early 1960s.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/silent-hill-f-is-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc-on-september-25-213338755.html\">The latest Silent HIll</a> still has jumpscares, like you\u2019d expect from the horror series, but the setting and game systems are more focused on tension, putting both Hinako and the player under constant duress. A typical health meter is joined by a sanity gauge and even your weapons have limited durability, so you\u2019re forced to pick your fights.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>During a two-hour demo, I had to do exactly that. As Hinako escapes her family home to find someone, anyone, to talk to, the village is eerily empty. A <em>kei</em> truck blocks the direct route to the local shop, with a crushed bird nearby adding to the weird. Soon, a sinister fog and red undergrowth attack four assembled high school students.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Silent Hill f preview\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/6d9e1730-7f4a-11f0-b336-1dc7a5a84569\" style=\"height: 1441px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Konami</div></figure>\n<p>Of course, it only gets weirder. As marionette nightmares pop up, all Hinako can do is run and evade attacks. A focus mode, pressing L1, burns the sanity gauge but gives better prompts for both dodging and eventually counter-attacking monsters.</p>\n<p>Hinako is no soldier. She\u2019s no battle-hardened survivor. When I eventually find a steel pipe to fight back with, even fast attacks are a little sluggish, while heavy swings, which can often stun and knock down enemies, take a while to charge up and can be hard to aim if you haven\u2019t locked onto the enemy. If there\u2019s more than one attacker, it\u2019s a tense struggle and I\u2019m often forced to burn through recovery items more so than when facing a sound and light-sensitive crawling beast, a fleshy-spherical ogre and other middleweight boss fights.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are <em>hokora</em>, miniature Shinto shrines, dotted around the village, which act as save points. The eerie location of Ebisugaoka and when a friend continually calls Hinako a &quot;traitor&quot; further amplify the sense of dread. The older sister is briefly shown during a flashback, but her face is obscured. Even in the younger sister\u2019s journal, the biog page for the sister is covered in scribbles and ink. It\u2019s very Japanese Horror, and less shotgun-to-the-zombie-face. And just plain stressful.</p>\n<p>A new sanity system is intriguing too. It's not an entirely new premise: the Gamecube's<em> Eternal Darkness </em>would manipulate the graphics and sound within the game as the character's sanity declined. But that was, depressingly, over 20 years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some items can top up your sanity, but if you don\u2019t use them, you can offer them at a shrine for an in-game currency and spend that on charms to boost Hinako\u2019s stats. I managed to afford a stamina-boosting charm during my playthrough and was tantalizingly close to affording another charm before getting cut down by scarecrows dressed as high-schoolers.</p>\n<p>The scarecrow confrontation is hopefully a good example of nuanced puzzles that will appear in the full game. Initially, a bloodied rag tells you to take the thorns out of the one scarecrow that isn\u2019t part of the group \u2013 the one that isn\u2019t going to cut you up with their sickle. Unfortunately, all of the scarecrows have a thorn, so you\u2019re tasked with finding the pattern of his group.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Silent Hill f preview\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/6d9abbd0-7f4a-11f0-b9ef-18f9b11ba031\" style=\"height: 1441px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Konami</div></figure>\n<p>The entire experience is drenched in atmosphere, supported by this new sanity system \u2014 is there anything more 2025 than a mental health gauge? The constant feeling of isolation (&quot;Where is everyone?&quot;) and unanswered questions made the demo a persuasive introduction to the game. A particularly tense moment involves collapsing after a fight, further emphasizing the character's vulnerability.

The X2D II 100C promises better image quality, a brighter display, 10-stop stabilization and updated hybrid autofocus. As with any Hasselblad product, it's expensive \u2014 but less so than the previous model.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The original X2D 100C took beautiful photos but lacked even basic technology like continuous autofocus. That's no longer the case. The X2D II 100C is the first Hasselblad camera with AF-C phase-detect AF backed by AI algorithms and LiDAR assistance, finally allowing burst shooting for movings subjects (albeit at a low 3 fps). With those changes, the new model promises \"fast and accurate\" AF, especially, in low light \u2014 which would be a big improvement over the previous model.&nbsp;</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At the same time, Hasselblad is pushing the image quality envelope further. The X2D II 100C is the first medium-format camera to support true end-end-end HDR, which reduces overexposure, enhances highlight retention and improves tonal depth for more natural looking images. Those can then be viewed directly on the display as HDR HEIF or Ultra HDR JPEG images. The updated 100MP BSI sensor also delivers 16-bit RAW images and up to 15.3 stops of dynamic range, among the highest of any camera available.</p> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Hasselblad's X2D II 100C offers 10 stops of stabilization and much-improved autofocus\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/36c286f0-818f-11f0-9ff6-d1e746ce673c\" style=\"height: 1607px; width: 2500px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Hasselblad\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>Another key change is the updated 5-axis in-body stabilization system. It now delivers up to 10 stops, more than any other camera (Fujifilm's GFX100 II offers 8 stops and some Canon models go up to 8.5 stops) \u2014 perfect for a high-resolution camera where sharpness is critical. With the new system, Hasselblad claims you can capture \"hand-held long exposures lasting several seconds without a tripod\" for extra creative possibilities.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The X2D II 100C weighs 7.5 percent less than the X2D 100C at around 730 grams without a lens \u2014 not bad at all for a medium format camera. The grip has also been updated with a textured surface to \"enhance comfort and control,\" the company wrote.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Other updates include a new 3.6-inch touch display with 1,400 nits of peak brightness that tilts 90 degrees upward and 43 degrees downward to make high and low angle shooting easier. Hasselblad also included a 5D joystick to change focus or operate the menus, addressing a big user complaint about the X2D 100C. It comes with 1TB of built-in storage as before \u2014 something almost no other mirrorless camera offers \u2014 along with a CFexpress Type B slot (as before, there's no support for video). Finally, Hasselblad introduced a new app, Phocus Mobile 2, that allows users to remotely control the camera, transfer shots and even edit them.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Hasselblad's X2D II 100C offers 10 stops of stabilization and much-improved autofocus\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/4c666210-818f-11f0-a3dd-909d308ea306\" style=\"height: 1572px; width: 2500px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Hasselblad\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>As for the price, it's less shocking than you may expect. The Hasselblad X2D II 100C is now on sale for $7,399, $800 less than the X2D 100C at launch and (perhaps strategically) $100 less than rival <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/fujifilm-gfx-100-ii-the-king-of-medium-format-mirrorless-cameras-143009929.html\">Fujifilm's GFX100 II</a> was at launch.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Hasselblad also introduced a new zoom lens, the XCD 2.8-4 35-100E (28-76mm full-frame equivalent). It promises \"top-tier\" optical performance and the fastest stepping motor in its XCD lens lineup, along with control rings for shutter speed, aperture and more. Like all Hasselblad lenses, it incorporates a leaf shutter that allows for up to 1/4000th flash sync speeds for easier use of fill light in bright conditions. The XCD 2.8-4 35-100E is now available for $4,599.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Finally, the company introduced the $469 Hasselblad-branded Vandra 20-liter backpack that will help you flaunt the brand name even if the camera's tucked away. It can hold an X2D II 100C body, two lenses and accessories. Finally, Hasselblad unveiled three new 86mm filters: a UV for $299, ND ($329) and circular polarizer (CPL) for $559.

The plan to convert Intel\u2019s previously promised CHIPS Act funding into equity in the company was first reported earlier in August. Intel was supposed to receive up to $10.86 billion in federal funding to expand its chip manufacturing business in the US as part of the CHIPS Act. By agreeing to this deal, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is likely trying to make sure funding still goes through, one of several drastic moves to keep Intel afloat. Tan assumed the title of CEO following Pat Gelsinger\u2019s sudden retirement in 2024.

Much of the time, the answer is simple: Get the best one you can afford. And if you\u2019re happy with your current iPhone, don\u2019t feel the need to make a change at all. But if you\u2019re ready to upgrade, allow us to help. We\u2019ve reviewed just about every iPhone ever released, so we\u2019ve picked through all nine models in Apple\u2019s current smartphone lineup and highlighted the ones that should satisfy most people below.<br /><br />Before we dive in, note that we\u2019ve based our guide on the list prices of new, unlocked iPhones on Apple.com. If you can find a steep discount from another trusted retailer or a good deal on a refurbished model, that could change the value equation.<br /><br />We\u2019ll also note that right now is arguably the worst time to buy a new model. Apple has released its latest iPhones each September like clockwork for several years, and we expect that trend to continue with the inevitable <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-max-and-air-release-dates-colors-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-about-apples-new-phones-153024847.html\">iPhone 17 series</a> (and the full <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-beta-how-to-download-the-update-on-your-iphone-new-features-like-liquid-glass-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-135749293.html\">iOS 26 update</a>) next month. So if you can hold out a little longer \u2014 even if it\u2019s just to save another $100 or so on last year\u2019s iPhone 16 devices, which will likely receive a price cut \u2014 you should.

The 15 Plus is particularly appealing as the most affordable big-screen iPhone in Apple\u2019s current lineup. It has excellent battery performance as well.</p> \n<p>At $699 or $799, though, both phones are priced in something of a no man\u2019s land. Most people who care about ultrawide cameras and MagSafe support should just spend another $100 for the iPhone 16 or 16 Plus, which add AI features, a slightly improved ultrawide lens with macro support, an extra hour or two of battery life, faster wireless charging (25W vs. 15W), a quicker processor, more RAM, the Action button and the Camera Control button.</p> \n<p>Those who aren't as particular about specs, meanwhile, are probably happy to save an extra $100 on the iPhone 16e, which is still better equipped for the long-term thanks to its faster chip and Apple Intelligence support. As a result, the 15 and 15 Plus will probably make the most sense if you can find a good price on a refurbished model.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-iphone-faqs\">iPhone FAQs</h2> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"The bottom half of both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max standing on a table.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-09/b9bf45e0-756d-11ef-b5db-383a7cce709c\" style=\"height: 1800px; width: 3200px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Brian Oh for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-when-is-the-best-time-of-year-to-buy-an-iphone\">When is the best time of year to buy an iPhone?</h3> \n<p>The best time to buy an iPhone, or really any product, is whenever you need one. But if you want to maximize how long your iPhone is considered \u201ccurrent,\u201d plan to upgrade in late September. Apple <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone#Models\">almost always</a> introduces its new core models around then. SE and \u201ce\u201d iPhones, meanwhile, have arrived between February and April, but those aren\u2019t guaranteed annual releases.</p> \n<p>Cash discounts on new unlocked iPhones are rare, so there usually isn\u2019t much reason to wait for a deal before buying (as is often the case with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-phones-are-on-sale-for-record-low-prices-170952808.html\">Samsung</a> or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/googles-pixel-9-pro-is-200-off-plus-the-rest-of-the-weeks-best-tech-deals-180041864.html\">Google</a> phones). Carriers will run their own sales, but those typically involve locking you into years-long service plans. The exception would be if you specifically want an older iPhone, since Apple typically cuts the price of its last-gen devices by $100 or more when it introduces a new model. So, for instance, if you know you won\u2019t care about the inevitable iPhone 17\u2019s upgrades, you could wait until that device is announced and get the iPhone 16 for a little cheaper.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-long-does-an-iphone-last\">How long does an iPhone last?</h3> \n<p>This depends on the person and how they define \u201clast.\u201d If we had to give a broad estimate, we\u2019d say most iPhone users keep their device between two and four years. If you\u2019re particularly sensitive to performance and camera improvements, you might want to upgrade on the earlier side of that timeline. If you\u2019re not as picky, you could hold out for even longer \u2014 though you\u2019ll likely want to get a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/battery-replacement\">battery replacement</a> sometime around the three- or four-year mark (or whenever you notice your battery life has severely degraded).</p> \n<p>Software support shouldn\u2019t be a problem regardless: Apple is renowned for keeping its devices up-to-date long-term, and the current version of iOS 18 is available on iPhones <a href=\"https://endoflife.date/iphone\">dating back to 2018</a>. (Though the forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-reveals-comprehensive-redesign-for-ios-26-at-wwdc-2025-171650751.html\">iOS 26 update</a> will push the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-is-releasing-ios-26-this-fall-will-your-iphone-be-compatible-191854628.html\">cutoff line</a> up a year.) Most of those older phones <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/121115\">don\u2019t support</a> Apple Intelligence, so there isn\u2019t <em>total</em> parity, but that\u2019s not a big loss in the grand scheme of things.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-i-know-how-old-my-iphone-is\">How do I know how old my iPhone is?</h3> \n<p>Go to your iPhone\u2019s Settings, then tap General &gt; About. You should see the Model Name right near the top. You can also tap the Model Number below that, then verify the resulting four-digit code on <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/108044\">Apple\u2019s identification page</a> to further confirm.</p> \n<p>If you don\u2019t want to use software, for whatever reason, you can also find your iPhone\u2019s model number <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/106343\">printed within</a> its USB-C or Lightning port, if the device lacks a SIM tray. For older devices, you can alternatively find that number within the SIM slot or \u2014 if you\u2019re still hanging onto an iPhone 7 or older \u2014 right on the back of the handset.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</h2> \n<p><strong>August 2025</strong>: We\u2019ve taken another pass to ensure our advice is still up-to-date and noted that we expect to Apple to launch new phones soon in September.</p> \n<p><strong>June 2025</strong>: We\u2019ve lightly edited this guide for clarity and added a few common FAQs.

Many members of the Imgur community have <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1mzsw9n/whats_up_with_imgur_raging_about_medialab/\"><ins>claimed</ins></a> that MediaLab fired most of its US content moderation team in favor of AI, while others have said that the site is <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/even-asking-whats-happening-is-enough-to-get-comments-deleted-as-such-you-business-daddy-XYiPkt2\"><ins>deleting</ins></a> or <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/is-imgur-really-killing-itself-q8yAazH\"><ins>hiding</ins></a> content that is critical of the owner and its policies.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The exact timeline, as well as what brought things to a tipping point, is still fuzzy at best. But for hours today, the Imgur homepage has been dominated by spammed images of a John Oliver meme in protest of what users see as MediaLab's poor management of the platform. Whatever team is currently working at Imgur appears to be unable to handle the rate that the memes are being posted, so it's anyone's guess how long the spam protest will dominate the front page.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/imgur-protest-covers-the-front-page-in-anti-medialab-memes-225502091.html?src=rss"}

Blizzard </span><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24224138/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">announced</span></a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> that Season 18 will introduce a new take on the progression system. As they currently stand, the progression numbers feel pretty divorced from the gameplay; this revamp introduces new ways to display your prowess to teammates and foes in matches as well as some welcome changes to how you see and equip your rewards.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The new Progression 2.0 system has overhauled the visual side. For starters, there will be new portrait frames that increase in fanciness every 20 levels, capping at level 60. These Ascended borders will be displayed when you pick your hero for a match. Between the different Ascended frames, players will unlock five tiers of hero badges that also display in Hero Select under your portrait.&nbsp;</span></p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot from Overwatch 2 showing the five new hero badges that can be unlocked.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/herobadges.jpeg\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>Overwatch 2 Hero Badges</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Blizzard</div></figure><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">In addition to the new flash, the Hero Select screen will show your allies a card with your top heroes on it. I doubt anyone will pay too much attention to cards in the Open Queue matches, so this seems like a Competitive-angled addition. It could help make it easy to build a team composition based on the whole group's strengths, creating a test of your crew's cooperation ability before the game even starts. Blizzard clarified that in Competitive, opponents won't be able to see your portrait borders until 10-15 seconds after a match begins, and hero cards won't be displayed to an enemy until one of you eliminates each other. That means nobody should be able to use your hero card against you in the </span><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/blizzard-explains-hero-bans-ahead-of-their-introduction-in-competitive-overwatch-210319297.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">ban phase</span></a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">I've almost never thought about the rewards I get for progression stats because it's unclear when I've gotten a new item and I rarely bother searching for them in my cosmetics collections, so having a dedicated progression menu added should place a new focus on tracking how far you've gotten with a particular character. The hero-specific rewards on the horizon will be displayed on that page, and already-unlocked items can be equipped directly from that menu. Blizzard is also offering occasional Epic and Legendary loot box freebies as you rise through the ranks for each hero, which is always welcome.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The progression levels will be rewarded retroactively when the season starts. For long-time fans, that means you can expect to see a whole bunch of rewards to browse through when you first log in during Season 18. For new players, there will be more credits and cosmetics available to unlock in the first 20 levels. That first set of 20 levels will also be scaled to be quicker to complete, while later levels will require more time.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The new season kicks off tomorrow, on August 26.

If you can't wait any longer, you can <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-install-the-ios-26-public-beta-171117199.html\">download and install</a> the newly released public beta 4 (or <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes\">iOS 26 developer beta 8</a> for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html\">taking screenshots</a> is way better in the new operating system \u2014 Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html\">preview of the iOS 26 public beta release</a>, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html\">Liquid Glass</a>, the translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-26-beta-preview-spotlights-time-to-shine-171700779.html\">macOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html\">iPadOS</a> and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/wwdc-2025-everything-apple-announced-including-ios-26-liquid-glass-design-and-more-171718030.html\">WWDC keynote</a> on June 9.</p>\n<p>After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Siri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant \u2014 first promised at WWDC 2024 \u2014 is delayed until some point \"<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html\">in the coming year</a>,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-chatgpt-claude-siri/\">basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models</a> like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-reportedly-has-a-stripped-down-ai-chatbot-to-compete-with-chatgpt-in-the-works-164345473.html\">'stripped-down' AI chatbot</a> to rival ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>With each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html\">new AirPods gesture</a> we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">freeze your video if it detects nudity</a>. With the release of the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes\">iOS 26 developer beta 5</a>, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/ios-26-beta-5-features/\"><em>MacRumors </em>reports</a>. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-is-releasing-ios-26-this-fall-heres-the-full-list-of-compatible-iphones-191854795.html\">eligible to download iOS 26 </a>(both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-is-ios-26\">What is iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>The current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it \u2014 version 18.6.1 was released to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apples-redesigned-blood-oxygen-monitoring-feature-hits-apple-watches-in-the-us-today-131558485.html\">restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring</a> functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-just-dropped-a-security-update-for-all-its-platforms-194528494.html\">Apple released 18.6.2</a> to address a vulnerability related to image processing. Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/22/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-6/\"><em>MacRumors reports</em></a>, which means it can no longer be installed on your iPhone due to a \"server-side software verification check.\" That's pretty normal when newer versions are available to download.</p>\n<p>But don't expect to see iOS 19 soon \u2014 or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"a list of the new OSes\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/29bbb6f0-4555-11f0-b2de-ada42a83075d\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>It's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-is-liquid-glass-design\">What is Liquid Glass design?</h2>\n<p>Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html\">new Liquid Glass design</a> was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year \u2014 the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.</p>\n<p>So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"<a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=86b7b54f-7ccd-4fbb-a927-09c327b93cbc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=new+translucent+material&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8wNi9hcHBsZS1lbGV2YXRlcy10aGUtaXBob25lLWV4cGVyaWVuY2Utd2l0aC1pb3MtMjYvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NmI3YjU0Zi03Y2NkLTRmYmItYTkyNy0wOWMzMjdiOTNjYmMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzcm9vbS8yMDI1LzA2L2FwcGxlLWVsZXZhdGVzLXRoZS1pcGhvbmUtZXhwZXJpZW5jZS13aXRoLWlvcy0yNi8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVivyXXsD7DiKwA3X-v-YLSp-mKPz8KpUrb1ctVS4Hji&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F06%2Fapple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26%2F\">new translucent material</a>\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some \u2014 including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar \u2014 like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-liquid-glass-is-windows-vista-done-well-181954910.html\">Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs</a> from nearly twenty years ago.</p>\n<p>That said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html\">has already incorporated some user feedback</a> into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-26-will-bring-apples-new-liquid-glass-ui-to-your-desktop-174149070.html\">the new macOS Tahoe 26</a> on your desktop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-are-the-new-and-notable-features-of-ios-26\">What are the new and notable features of iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:</p>\n<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages:</strong> iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Polls in group chats:</strong> Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.</p>\n<p><strong>Filtering unknown senders in Messages:</strong> If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual Intelligence:</strong> Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html\">screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence</a> to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.</p>\n<p><strong>Photos tabs are back:</strong> For anyone who's still frustrated with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-apple-redesigned-its-photos-app-around-customization-120038901.html\">Photos changes made last year</a>, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: </strong>A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature</a> that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-customize-your-iphones-lock-screen-on-ios-26-110535863.html\"><strong>New lock screen options</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"New Hold Assist being displayed at the wwdc keynote\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/a506ddc0-4556-11f0-9d7a-9a93e6a181c1\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes.

Here's what's coming this fall.</p>\n<p><strong>Multitasking and real windowing:</strong> When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual update:</strong> Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.</p>\n<p><strong>New menu bar:</strong> When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.</p>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html\">first impressions of iPadOS 26</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-about-airpods\">What about AirPods?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ios-26-updates-for-airpods-preview-enhanced-audio-recording-camera-remote-and-more-173036046.html\">AirPods are also getting updated</a> with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced audio recording:</strong> Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Camera remote control:</strong> Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.</p>\n<p><strong>Live translation feature:</strong> While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html\">could be coming with iOS 26</a>. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time.

As with most unreleased iPhones, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Apple in September.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-are-the-latest-iphone-17-rumors\">What are the latest iPhone 17 rumors?</h2>\n<p>Not necessarily a \"new\" rumor but Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes there actually will be a new orange color offered for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, as well as a light blue color for the iPhone 17 Air, he <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-24/apple-to-launch-iphone-17-pro-iphone-17-air-in-september-iphone-fold-next-year-mepmzpcj\">confirmed in his weekly Power On newsletter</a>.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Additionally, we have a new case rumor.<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/25/apple-liquid-silicone-iphone-17-case-colors/\"> According to leaker Majin Bu</a>, there will be new Liquid Silicone cases in eight colors, including Deep Orange, Pale Orange, Grass Green, Celadon, Fog Purple, Grey Blue, Dark Blue and Midnight Black.&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"74cbca8d2df64cbca62aec5d73509fc7\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">iPhone 17: New Liquid Silicone Cases Colors<br /><br />Full Article:<a href=\"https://t.co/RBnAO3LCAC\">https://t.co/RBnAO3LCAC</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/GuQuvrswg6\">pic.twitter.com/GuQuvrswg6</a></p>\u2014 Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1959594436691886573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 24, 2025</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>These rumors haven't been confirmed by Apple and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models will look like until the iPhone event next month.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-much-will-the-iphone-17-cost\">How much will the iPhone 17 cost?</h2>\n<p>Apple's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-to-invest-another-100-billion-into-the-us-to-avoid-tariffs-210250020.html\">announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners</a> seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/gaming/deals/article/ps5-console-prices-have-gone-up-heres-where-you-can-still-get-them-for-50-less-211140296.html\">PlayStations</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-original-nintendo-switch-is-about-to-get-more-expensive-in-the-us-170646701.html\">Switch consoles</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/nikon-joins-other-camera-manufacturers-in-raising-prices-due-to-tariffs-120011854.html\">high-end cameras</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/sonos-is-raising-prices-this-year-to-make-up-for-tariff-expenses-123031336.html\">Sonos speakers</a>. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/will-iphone-17-pro-start-at-256gb-storage/\">posted by <em>MacRumors</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>from a leaker known as \"<a href=\"https://weibo.com/u/5143897135\">Instant Digital</a>,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/30/iphone-17-price-increase-expected/\">price increase of $50</a>, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/every-macbook-air-now-starts-with-16gb-of-ram-at-no-extra-cost-150041320.html\">doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers</a> from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 \u2014 but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-when-will-the-iphone-17s-be-announced\">When will the iPhone 17 series be announced?</h2>\n<p>Most years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/apple-iphone-17-event-set-september-9/\"><em>MacRumors </em>highlighted</a> a story originally reported by <a href=\"https://www.iphone-ticker.de/iphone-17-vorstellung-wohl-am-9-verkaufsstart-am-19-september-261445/\">iphone-ticker.de</a> that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.</p>\n<p>It's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-reportedly-wants-to-split-up-the-iphones-release-schedule-164737099.html\">split</a> into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-new-iphone-17-lineup-include\">What will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?</h2>\n<p>Design leaks suggest that Apple is building an <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-said-to-be-working-on-a-significantly-thinner-iphone-180823565.html\">ultra-thin smartphone</a>, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/this-year-could-bring-the-iphone-air-and-an-entry-level-ipad-with-apple-intelligence-175059162.html\">reported</a> in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16e-review-whats-your-acceptable-compromise-020016288.html\">iPhone 16e</a>. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.</p>\n<p>An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/iphone-17-air-titanium-rumor/\">indicated</a> that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.</p>\n<p>Additionally, an August 4 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/04/iphone-17-air-battery-half-thickness-17-pro/\"><em>MacRumors </em>report</a> says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick \u2014 half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the <a href=\"https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=223958615195&amp;navType=by\">Korean-language Naver blog</a>, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, <em>MacRumors</em> notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)</p>\n<p>On a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/iphone-17-pro-leak-aluminum-chassis/\">according to <em>MacRumors</em></a>. Originally <a href=\"https://majinbuofficial.com/iphone-17-pro-antennas-repositioned-around-the-camera-module/\">posted by leaker Majin Bu</a>, the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. <em>MacRumors</em> says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight.</p>\n<p>That same leaker (Majin Bu), whom <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/iphone-17-pro-antenna-rumor/\"><em>MacRumors </em></a>classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual <a href=\"https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1954890746693312762\">posted a render on X</a> that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://majinbuofficial.com/iphone-17-new-tech-woven-case-unveiled/\">Leaker Majin Bu also claims</a> \"TechWoven\" cases could be introduced, per a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/20/techwoven-cases-crossbody-strap-rumor/\"><em>MacRumors</em> report</a>. The cases match the rumored design on the iPhone 17 models, with the wide camera bump. The leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for \"convenient and secure carrying,\" so it could be worn around your neck. The colors would come in grey/black, blue, green, purple and orange.</p>\n<p>Each new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the <a href=\"https://x.com/Skyfops/status/1949936265232888057\">purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\"</a> The pics, highlighted on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/28/iphone-17-pro-possibly-spotted-in-the-wild/\"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.</p>\n<div id=\"a462ba8164d54c5a8ac8626b1540fe2f\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29 <a href=\"https://t.co/iS3PtKWqxJ\">pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ</a></p>\u2014 Fox Pupy \ud83e\udd8a\ud83e\udde1 (@Skyfops) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Skyfops/status/1949936265232888057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 28, 2025</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>The iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus.

He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 \u2014 likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.</p>\n<p>We've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2849423/iphone-17-colors-confirmed-see-all-of-apples-2026-options-right-here.html\"><em>Macworld</em></a> reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.</p>\n<p>On July 30, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/iphone-17-dummies-just-leaked-in-all-colors-and-theres-a-bold-new-signature-hue\"><em>Tom's Guide</em></a> highlighted an X post from <a href=\"https://x.com/SonnyDickson/status/1950325609957380405\">Sonny Dickson</a> \u2014 a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information \u2014 showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned <em>Macworld</em> story. While these are literally just mock-ups \u2014 not real, leaked iPhones \u2014 it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.</p>\n<p>To add the the rumors, a Weibo leaker known as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/\">Digital Chat Station</a> suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/18/iphone-17e-rumored-to-gain-new-design-and-more/\"><em>MacRumors</em> reports</a>. According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. However, it's important to note this report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16e-review-whats-your-acceptable-compromise-020016288.html\">iPhone 16e</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-new-ios-be-like\">What will iOS 26 be like?</h2>\n<p>Apple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-public-beta-is-live-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-iphone-features-and-how-to-use-them-135749325.html\">iOS 26</a>.</p>\n<p>On the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html\">scaling down</a> the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.</p>\n<p>The feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">freeze FaceTime video</a> if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.</p>\n<p>iOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls.

That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html\">watchOS 26</a>, of course.) Other possibilities \u2014 and this is, again, speculation \u2014 could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218-130048292.html\">last big update in 2022</a>) and maybe new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apples-next-airtag-is-coming-in-2025-with-privacy-improvements-173028439.html\">AirTags trackers</a> (first released in 2021).</p>\n<p>The Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/every-apple-secret-that-leaked-yesterday/\"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/new-apple-tv-coming-later-this-year-with-a17-pro-chip/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/homepod-mini-new-chip/\">HomePod mini</a>, new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 \u2014 if ever.

Why would they settle for less?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">It's not clear if this plan replaces Perplexity's existing Publisher Program, or will exist alongside it.

The biggest change is that all of the new Nest devices built-in cameras will reportedly record in 2K resolution, rather than 1080p. They'll also come in a selection of new colors. The Nest Cam Indoor comes in &quot;Snow&quot; (white), &quot;Berry&quot; (red) and &quot;Hazel&quot; (gray). The camera will include a new &quot;Zoom and Crop&quot; feature that lets you crop a camera feed to focus on a specific area, and be able to store up to an hour of footage locally if your Wi-Fi goes out. Google also plans to expand how long it'll store video previews of events Nest Cams detect, taking the library of 10-second previews from one hour to three.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(32, 43, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The Nest Cam Outdoor will only come in Snow and Hazel, but it'll reportedly include all the new features of the Nest Cam Indoor. The same goes for the new Nest Doorbell, except it'll be available in Snow, Hazel and &quot;Linen&quot; (beige). The decision to largely use the same design on its Nest devices and focus on changing internal components and software features is a similar strategy to what Google used with the </span><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-series-hands-on-the-base-model-takes-center-stage-160040470.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Pixel 10 lineup</span></a><span style=\"color: rgb(32, 43, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">. The phones largely look the same, but they feature improved internals and plenty of new software features.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(32, 43, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><em>Android Headlines</em> writes that Google plans to use this hardware launch to also rebrand its Nest Aware and Aware Plus subscriptions. The new name for Google's entry-level smart home subscription will be Google Home Premium. The company also plans to sell a Google Home Premium Advanced. As far as which subscription offers what, and if certain Gemini features will be locked behind a higher price, we'll have to wait until Google details its smart home plans. The company said Gemini for Home will launch in October, so expect more official announcements in the coming months.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/googles-new-smart-home-hardware-looks-mostly-familiar-in-leaked-images-190011191.html?src=rss"}

This is another new low, and it applies to various color options and storage configs.</p> \n<p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DK3W6TV6&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=5c2b9c33-9a87-45ff-b978-e41b8f7a90a2&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Apple+iPad+mini+%28A17+Pro%29+for+%24399+%28%24100+off%29&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLWlQYWQtTWluaS1BMTctUHJvL2RwL0IwREszVzZUVjYvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjVjMmI5YzMzLTlhODctNDVmZi1iOTc4LWU0MWI4ZjdhOTBhMiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1pUGFkLU1pbmktQTE3LVByby9kcC9CMERLM1c2VFY2LyIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXybJq3Z7EzDSF65W3vdVIIgX8pEsTNAtFGt13v0bYAY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPad-Mini-A17-Pro%2Fdp%2FB0DK3W6TV6%2F\"><strong>Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off)</strong></a>: The iPad mini is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-mini-7-review-safe-boring-and-everything-i-want-in-a-small-tablet-130039378.html\">exactly what it sounds like</a>: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip \u2014 which is enough to support Apple Intelligence \u2014 along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As before, you\u2019d buy it if you value the smaller 8.3-inch display and want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. This deal is $20 more than the lowest price we've tracked.

Silicone cases tend to be thinner and feel soft to the touch, and they're often easier to put on and take off of phones. Hard cases can be on the thicker side, but they provide a bit more drop protection than silicone cases. Which type of case is best for you depends on the type of experience you want from your phone. It's also worth nothing that both silicone cases and hard cases come in a variety of colors, designs and styles, so you have plenty of choose from to match your personality on both sides.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-does-an-iphone-16-need-a-screen-protector\">Does an iPhone 16 need a screen protector?</h3> \n<p>The iPhone 16 features Apple\u2019s tough Ceramic Shield front, which is definitely more durable than standard glass \u2014 but it\u2019s not invincible. If you want to avoid scratches from keys, drops onto pavement or just the wear and tear of daily use, a screen protector is still a smart move. It adds an extra layer of defense without getting in the way of touch sensitivity or Face ID. So, while it\u2019s not absolutely essential, using one is a good idea if you want to keep your screen looking flawless for the long haul.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-is-the-iphone-16-drop-proof\">Is the iPhone 16 drop-proof?</h3> \n<p>The iPhone 16 is built to be tough, with Ceramic Shield on the front and a sturdy aluminum or titanium frame (depending on the model), but it\u2019s not completely drop-proof. It can handle the occasional bump or short fall, especially if it lands on a flat surface \u2014 but drops on concrete or at awkward angles can still cause cracks or damage. If you\u2019re prone to butterfingers, pairing your iPhone 16 with a durable case and maybe even a screen protector is the best way to play it safe.</p> \n<p><em>Georgie Peru contributed to this report.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-iphone-cases-153035988.html?src=rss"}

and treat its cases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Doctors referred Rihan to the Gaza Eye Hospital for an emergency operation due to her severe injury.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Because of&nbsp;the influx of wounded and the collapse of the medical system, she didn\u2019t enter the operating room until two days later, resulting in complete vision loss in her right eye and near-total damage to her left.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what saddens me more: losing my sight, my parents and family, or our home,\u201d Rihan said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI long to see the light again,

Thousands more require care but are not yet classified as critical.</p>\n\n<p>Medical evacuations are blocked by Israel, which has imposed a tight siege on Gaza since the start of the war.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At the current pace, it could take five to 10 years to transfer all those in critical need of medical treatment, according to the WHO.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTwo weeks after Maria\u2019s injury, I submitted all required documents to the WHO,\u201d Mohammed told MEE.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still waiting for a response.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Hospital destroyed by Israel</h3>\n\n<p>At Gaza\u2019s Eye Hospital, the situation is nothing short of catastrophic, said Dr Majed Kaheel, a consultant ophthalmologist and senior physician.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking to MEE, Kaheel described how the facility - Gaza\u2019s primary eye care centre - is overwhelmed by a flood of patients it can no longer adequately treat.</p>\n\n<p>A massive number of patients arrive daily, including those with chronic conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and paediatric eye cancer, alongside those suffering severe eye trauma from Israeli attacks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDiabetic patients need regular laser sessions or intraocular injections,\u201d Kaheel explained.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBut with our laser equipment destroyed [in Israeli strikes] and injections unavailable, we\u2019re powerless to save their vision.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Glaucoma patients, too, are at risk of permanent blindness, he said, with no access to essential visual field tests, intraocular pressure monitoring, or surgical intervention due to a lack of equipment and functioning operating rooms.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe mustn\u2019t forget the dozens of children with eye cancer who couldn\u2019t be referred abroad and ended up losing their sight,\u201d he added. \u201cSome no longer require treatment - because they were killed in air strikes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>While the Palestinian Ministry of Health has yet to release official figures on eye-related injuries from the war, Kaheel shared internal data collected by the hospital\u2019s medical team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>'We're powerless to save their vision'</p>\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Dr Majed Kaheel,&nbsp;consultant ophthalmologist</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In June alone, 20 percent of war-related injuries were to the eyes, of which 40 percent resulted in total blindness.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTragically, that rate rose in July to 28 percent, coinciding with the shootings at aid distribution points,\u201d Kaheel said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMany people were shot while waiting for food. Even those who didn\u2019t lose their sight are left with severe visual impairments.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He emphasised that visually impaired people are among the war\u2019s most vulnerable, especially as displacement continues and many are forced to live in tents.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re far more likely to suffer additional injuries,\u201d Kaheel said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cUnpaved roads, makeshift toilets, and the chaos of crowded camps increase the risk of falls and further harm.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA blind or visually impaired person depends on others to navigate this already dire environment of tents and shared facilities. It deepens the suffering for everyone.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div>\n            <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\">\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n          </div>\n              <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\">Gaza City, occupied Palestine </div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div>\n        <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\">\n    <div>Post Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\">\n    <div>Update Date</div>\n              <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\">\n    <div>Update Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n\n  </div>\n  \n</article>"}

take deported illegal migrants.</p>\n\n<p>The Telegraph <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/08/26/taliban-ready-and-willing-work-with-nigel-farage-migrants/\">reported</a> that a senior Taliban official based in Kabul said: \"We are ready and willing to receive and embrace whoever he [Farage] sends us.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are prepared to work with anyone who can help end the struggles of Afghan refugees, as we know many of them do not have a good life abroad.\"</p>\n\n<p>The official reportedly said: \"We will not take money to accept our own people, but we welcome aid to support newcomers, since there are challenges in accommodating and feeding those returning from Iran and Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p>\"Afghanistan is home to all Afghans, and the Islamic Emirate is determined to make this country a place where everyone \u2013 those already here, those returning, or those being sent back from the West by Mr Farage or anyone else \u2013 can live with dignity.\"</p>\n\n<h3>Taliban says Reform 'maybe easier to deal with'</h3>\n\n<p>Responding to the official's comments, Yusuf <a href=\"https://x.com/ZiaYusufUK/status/1960403261770354983\">said</a>: \"Reform continues to show the way. If only this awful [Labour] government would step aside.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Taliban official also reportedly suggested Farage may be easier to work with than the Labour government.</p>\n\n<p>\"We will have to see what Mr Farage does when or if he becomes prime minister of Britain, but since his views are different, it may be easier to deal with him than with the current ones,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>\"We will accept anyone he sends, whether they are legal or illegal refugees in Britain.\"</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    \n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Significantly, after Farage's announcement, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/08/26/taliban-ready-and-willing-work-with-nigel-farage-migrants/\">indicated</a> the Labour government would not rule out a returns agreement with Afghanistan, saying: \"We\u2019re not going to take anything off the table.\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>'We will accept anyone he sends, whether they are legal or illegal refugees in Britain'</p>\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;- Unnamed senior Taliban official</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But in a speech on Wednesday Nick Thomas-Symonds, the EU relations minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/aug/27/conservatives-consider-deal-afghanistan-migrants-uk-politics-latest-updates-news\">dismissed</a> Reform's proposal as \"outlandish\" and accused him of \"dividing communities and stoking anger\".</p>\n\n<p>The Conservative party's chair, Kevin Hollinrake, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/aug/27/conservatives-consider-deal-afghanistan-migrants-uk-politics-latest-updates-news\">told</a> Times Radio his party would \"potentially\" be willing to strike a deal with the Taliban to return migrants.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - an independent MP and key figure in the founding of a new unnamed left-wing party - <a href=\"https://x.com/jeremycorbyn/status/1960631158166671441\">said</a>: \"I am sickened by the relentless demonisation of refugees.</p>\n\n<p>\"No refugee underfunded a school. No refugee closed a hospital. No refugee took away support from the sick and disabled.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\"We need solutions not scapegoats.

The head of Double Fine, a studio best known for the <em>Psychonauts</em> series, is trying to explain <em>Keeper</em>, a puzzle adventure game where you are, literally, a sentient, walking lighthouse. Double Fine is now one of several studios bought up by Microsoft and the team apparently took the opportunity to lean into all the resources available and, he said, \u201cmake something weird.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"c98731aa3a06421b8f61c74914b21ac8\"></div>\n<p>It\u2019s definitely that. The colors and atmosphere of <em>Keeper</em> have at least the touch of Psychonauts DNA. <em>Keeper</em> puts players in control of the aforementioned lighthouse, awakened (and joined) by a curious, occasionally aggressive, bird named Twig.  Interestingly, the lighthouse currently has no name.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Double Fine's art director, Lee Petty came up with the concept for the game, apparently inspired by his time spent hiking during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is reflected in a lot of ways, whether its the rolling hills and landscapes that the anthropomorphised lighthouse roams, or the fact that there\u2019s not a single word of dialogue. The interactions between the bird and building, which seem to pepper both cutscenes and gameplay, are like Pixar shorts.</p>\n<p>The environments have a drippy surrealist style to them to, and the lack of a map, health bar or any HUD at all means you\u2019re not distracted as you explore and solve puzzles.</p>\n<p>In some early gameplay footage, I saw how the lighthouse's main form of interaction comes from its light beam. Not only does this help you seek out pathways and objects, but it can also be focused on the countless skittering creatures. Sometimes this causes creatures to flee, while other times they\u2019ll offer up magical orbs willingly and unwillingly, which open up later areas or bring towering creatures (structures?) to life. In Double Fine fashion, things look weird, too, with melted mountain peaks with more than a dost of Dali.</p>\n<p>You don't <em>have</em> to attack everything, either. During three different gameplay demos, I watched all kinds of creatures hide, run, and just exist in this world where humanity has long since disappeared. Oh there\u2019s briefly a giant flying whale too.</p>\n<p>Using the lighthouse\u2019s beam on certain things will leave an twinkling spark behind, meaning that Twig the bird can interact with it. During a later segment, the lighthouse can manipulate time, turning its bird companion back into an egg while a building repairs itself \u2014 and frees up a pathway. Twig remains an egg for a while until later, when the lighthouse can fast-forward time. Abilities like this seem location-dependent, rather than a Metroidvania collection of skills built up over the game. At another juncture, the lighthouse walks into a cloud of pink fluffy mist, unlocking the ability to jump and float around levels.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Keeper\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/0bf037f0-7e93-11f0-953b-dcafdb975057\" style=\"height: 1358px; width: 2436px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Double Fine</div></figure>\n<p>Schafer says the themes of life-changing and metamorphosis will continue to bubble up during<em> Keeper </em>and<em>&nbsp;</em>the lighthouse and bird duo is clearly central to all of it. It reminds me a little of <em>Banjo Kazooie</em> (the latter was a bird) but also <em>Ico</em>; at one point, the seemingly impervious lighthouse loses its footing, but Twig willfully tries to drag their partner to safety. Did Twig even help? Maybe not, but the sentiment was there.</p>\n<p><em>Keeper </em>will launch on Xbox Series S|X and PC on October 17th, including Xbox Game Pass.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/doublefine-keeper-gameplay-gamescom2025-123038715.html?src=rss"}

Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed, and nearly the entire population has been forcibly displaced multiple times. Rising starvation deaths amid an Israeli blockade and aid sites described as \"killing sites\" accompany increasing warning bells from international humanitarian agencies describing this as genocide.<br />\n<br />\nYet, many countries seem reluctant to use the word. Last year, UK Foreign Minister David Lammy suggested that not enough people had been killed for it to warrant the term.

In Gaza, where Israel is imposing a policy of forced starvation, coffee now costs $50 an ounce.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Before Hussam was killed on Monday alongside four other journalists, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-kills-middle-east-eye-journalists-gaza-nasser-hospital\">including</a> Middle East Eye correspondents&nbsp;Mohamed Salama&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ahmed Abu Aziz, his home had already been destroyed by Israeli attacks. Neighbours who came here to mourn sat on slabs of stone arranged in a circle around the torn tarpaulins where his family, stunned and grieving, huddled for shelter.</p>\n\n<p>Hussam\u2019s wife Samaher - who suffers from a severe skin disease that has been getting worse amid the lack of treatment in besieged Gaza, to the point where she can barely move - has now lost her husband, who was her primary support system. As mourners gathered at their home, their 15-year-old son, Ahmad, sat in silence. Their 18-year-old daughter, Shatha, remembered that their dad would have turned 50 next year.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPhotography had been his passion for 20 years, and he worked for Palestine TV and Reuters because he always wanted the world to see what was happening here in Gaza,\u201d Shatha told MEE. \u201cNow they killed him because he showed the world.\u201d</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    \n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>In our camp, Hussam was no stranger. He was kin, married to our neighbour\u2019s daughter. As my cousin Mohammed put it: \u201cHe is one of us. He was not only our neighbour and our friend, but our voice. His only crime was documenting genocide.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Israel\u2019s double-tap strike on Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza on Monday <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/25/israel-bombs-hospital-kills-journalists-medics-dozens-more-across-gaza\">killed 21 people</a>, including the five journalists. The first missile struck around 11am local time (09:00 BST), as doctors were doing their morning rounds. Minutes later, after rescuers had rushed to the scene, Israel forces hit again.</p>\n\n<h3>Vicious propaganda</h3>\n\n<p>My brother, a physician at Nasser Hospital, was working on the ground floor in the radiology department when the first bomb hit. He and his colleagues continued treating the wounded, even as the building shook. Among those killed was a sixth-year medical student whose family had been waiting to see him graduate and wear his white coat. Instead, they buried him.</p>\n\n<p>The targeting of Nasser Hospital encapsulates the dual assault Israel is waging: on those who heal and on those who bear witness, including Hussam and his colleagues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live/live-54-palestinians-killed-831-wounded-24-hours\"><b><i>Follow Middle East Eye's live coverage of the Israel-Palestine war</i></b></a></p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    \n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Since 7 October 2023, Israel has waged a war on truth, choosing vicious propaganda at every turn. It has worked to destroy the reputation of any organisation or individual who can offer credible testimony about the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/explainers/meaning-definition-what-genocide-israel-gaza\">genocide</a>, including by smearing the United Nations refugees agency, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-unrwa-ban-collapse-palestine-health-education-food\">Unrwa</a>. Even the protesters in the streets of Tel Aviv have been dismissed as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TvLdJcbdfXs\">strengthening Hamas</a>\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Israel has kept international journalists locked out of Gaza, in an approach that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres says has allowed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/un-chief-demands-israel-allow-foreign-journalists-to-enter-gaza-says-situation-enables-false-narratives-to-flourish/\">disinformation</a> and false narratives to flourish\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The final - and most horrific - tool in the Israeli armoury is the persecution and execution of journalists. A recent <a href=\"https://www.972mag.com/israel-gaza-journalists-hamas-hasbara/\">report from +972 magazine</a> reveals how Israel deployed a special military unit to track and target Palestinian journalists in Gaza. The practical evidence for this is strong.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each silenced journalist represents not only a stolen life, but a stolen story; a missing piece of truth, a further attempt to write Palestinians out of history</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since October 2023, Israel has killed <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live-blog/live-blog-update/israeli-attacks-have-killed-240-journalists-war-began\">more than 270</a> journalists and media workers in Gaza. These numbers surpass every conflict zone in modern history, with Israel <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/how-western-media-helped-turn-israels-genocide-fake-news\">killing more</a> journalists during the past 22 months in Gaza than the combined toll of media workers from both World Wars, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the wars in the former Yugoslavia, and the Afghanistan War combined.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Groups focused on media freedom have sounded the alarm. The Committee to Protect Journalists has called it the <a href=\"https://cpj.org/2023/12/israel-gaza-war-takes-record-toll-on-journalists-2/\">deadliest conflict</a> on record for media workers. The International Federation of Journalists cited a mortality rate of <a href=\"https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/blog/detail/category/articles-blogs/article/ifjblog-gazas-journalists-face-hunger-as-well-as-bombing\">10 percent</a> among media workers - and that was more than a year ago. Reporters Without Borders has <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/rsf-files-third-complaint-icc-about-israeli-war-crimes-against-journalists-gaza\">filed complaints</a> at the International Criminal Court.</p>\n\n<p>Journalists around the world are clearly in shock at the scale of the killings of their colleagues - but there has been no meaningful, coordinated action to protest it.</p>\n\n<p>International law is unequivocal: the killing of journalists is a crime. After months of mounting evidence, no state or institution can claim ignorance. We owe Hussam - and all those like him - not only mourning, but decisive action. Their sacrifice must galvanise the world to demand accountability and insist that the Palestinian narrative, long suppressed and silenced, be heard in full. Anything less is complicity.</p>\n\n<p>As a collective, media workers must demand an immediate halt to Israel\u2019s killing of Palestinian journalists. Coordinated action, such as a planned temporary stoppage of all news coverage in order to draw attention to this issue, could be a good place to start.</p>\n\n<h3>Stolen stories</h3>\n\n<p>These killings are not random. Journalists in Gaza climb to rooftops and hilltops to secure a faint signal, upload photographs, identify strike zones and tell the story. Israel\u2019s strikes have turned those very spaces - hospitals, media offices, homes - into death traps. Each attack is not only an assault on individual lives, but on the very act of bearing witness.</p>\n\n<p>This point must be highlighted clearly: the target is not only these journalists, but the Palestinian narrative itself. It is a strategy of erasure. Each silenced journalist represents not only a stolen life, but a stolen story; a missing piece of truth, a further attempt to write Palestinians out of history.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\">\n  <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/ahmed-abu-aziz-mees-gaza-correspondent-who-reported-through-pain-and-loss\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/pictures/2025-08/IMG_4170.jpeg.webp?itok=KRz_jwel\" width=\"400\" />\n\n</a>  <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Ahmed Abu Aziz: MEE's Gaza correspondent who reported through pain and loss</div>\n    <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/ahmed-abu-aziz-mees-gaza-correspondent-who-reported-through-pain-and-loss\">Read More \u00bb</a>\n</div>\n\n<p>For more than a century, Palestinians have been silenced - their testimonies dismissed, their archives erased, their memories attacked. Israel\u2019s killing of journalists today is a continuation of that long project of suppression; an attempt to deny Palestinians the right to narrate their own history.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The strike on Monday is a crime of the gravest order. To deliberately target a hospital - a space protected under international law - and kill journalists, medics and rescue workers constitutes a flagrant violation of the Geneva Conventions, and an assault on the very infrastructure of life and survival. And this is not an aberration; it is part of a systematic pattern of violations.</p>\n\n<p>What happened to Hussam and his four colleagues feels very personal to me. When I worked in Gaza as a journalist and translator, I sat on the stairways of Nasser Hospital. I knew well the walls that now lie in ruins.</p>\n\n<p>But their killing is also profoundly political, in the context of Israel\u2019s systematic efforts to extinguish Palestinian voices.</p>\n\n<p>The continued flow of weapons and political cover makes western states not bystanders, but active partners in these crimes. Sanctions and arms embargoes are not optional gestures of disapproval; they are the minimum obligations of a world order that still claims to uphold human rights and international law.</p>\n\n<p><i>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.</i></p>\n</div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div>\n        <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\">\n    <div>Post Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\">\n    <div>Update Date</div>\n              <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\">\n    <div>Update Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n\n  </div>\n  \n</article>"}

Mohamed had to travel across dangerous areas in Gaza to meet Abdullah al-Yazuri, the boy featured in the documentary.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe insisted on doing it, and in the end, we published Abdullah\u2019s first reaction to the BBC decision - an exclusive that only Middle East Eye was able to secure,\u201d Shalaby said.</p>\n\n<p>For another story about Abdulrahim 'Amir' al-Jarabe, a 10-year-old <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/gaza-family-boy-amir-killed-ghf-site-still-have-not-received-his-body\">killed at an aid site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation</a>, Salama and Asfour spent two weeks combing every hospital and morgue in Gaza to identify the child.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey went through every record of children named Amir who had been killed during that period, comparing photographs and footage. Mohammed went through every image and clip, sending them to me so we could verify,\u201d Shalaby said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStep by step, we followed new leads until we confirmed Amir\u2019s real name, identity, and family.

Together, the pair forged a team of reporters in southern Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMohamed and Hala were at the heart of our daily coverage,\" said Shalaby, \"from famine and starvation to the suffering of civilians across Gaza. Their persistence, courage, and dedication are what real journalism looks like. They are the true heroes of this work.\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>'We write amidst death, documenting the suffering so it is not forgotten'</p>\n\n<p>-&nbsp;<em>Mohammed Salama</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Beyond their professional collaboration, their relationship provided some refuge from the horrors they were painstakingly documenting.</p>\n\n<p>In a post on Instagram announcing their engagement, accompanied by footage of the pair walking hand in hand through the ruins of Khan Younis, it said: \u201cDespite the war and what distress and anxiety has come upon us, we give each other safety.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In a post on Facebook, journalist Wa\u2019ad AboZaher described how the couple would drink a cup of coffee with her in the mornings. She recalled a conversation with Asfour, in which she asked her: \u201cWhy do we find love during war?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Asfour replied with a laugh: \u201cBecause we\u2019re unlucky.\"</p>\n\n<p>Then she said, \u201cIf nothing can save us from death, then let love at least save us from life, my friend.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Like all Gaza\u2019s journalists, Salama\u2019s reporting came at great personal cost. His last Instagram post, published on World Press Freedom Day, reads: \u201cJournalism is not a profession - it is pain.

We had just been in touch the day before. I called Ahmed's number, hoping against hope he would pick up. A friend of his answered his mobile. I asked him if Ahmed was alive. He said he might have been killed, but he would check when he returned to the hospital.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am on my way to bury my other friends,\u201d he said. Five minutes passed before Ahmed's death was confirmed. It was a picture of his body, surrounded by his wife and mother, sent to me on WhatsApp.</p>\n\n<p>We had never met, but we had been in touch with each other every day for the last 22 months, and had grown to know each other.</p>\n\n<p>Ahmed would message or call every morning and update me with the latest news. He would religiously send every detail of each death, the names killed, the footage.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    \n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>In the last year, a distinctive element of doubt was embedded in each text from Ahmed. They ended with the same three words: \u201cAre you interested?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mass death in Gaza had become the new norm, and the lack of interest of the international media made Ahmed - and every journalist trying to operate there - unsure if anyone out there was really interested any more.</p>\n\n<p>A few months ago, I asked him to send me a quote about a journalist colleague who was killed. He asked me: \u201cWhat will you write about me when I die?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I told him he would not die and changed the subject.</p>\n\n<h3>Strong personal bonds</h3>\n\n<p>I was his bureau chief, at least as far as Middle East Eye was concerned. To perform that function when the life of my colleagues can end at any minute is to reshape my relationship with the team on the ground.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    \n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>They become far more than freelancers pitching stories. They are brothers and sisters that I check on every day, and they on me. I know how they sleep, if they have found something to eat. We speak about details that get buried under the headlines.</p>\n\n<p>We have learned to look after each other and build strong personal bonds. It's the only thing to lean on when the free world abandons any effort to stop Israel committing <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/explainers/meaning-definition-what-genocide-israel-gaza\">genocide</a>.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live/live-54-palestinians-killed-831-wounded-24-hours\">Follow Middle East Eye's live coverage of the Israel-Palestine war</a></strong></em></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>A few days ago, I had to fly back from London to be with my mother after getting a message from my family saying that she was near death.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing prepares you for the loss of a parent.

In London, I could move from one place to another without going through roadblocks or seeing people with guns. &nbsp;I could speak Arabic without having anyone staring at me.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whom, I wonder, does Israel want to defeat?&nbsp;Is it those little faces and hands of starving children holding pots to get food?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ahmed sensed something was wrong. He texted me on Saturday while I was on my way back. He said he felt I was going through something, but I did not want to tell him about the condition of my mother.</p>\n\n<p>We Palestinians who live outside of Gaza feel that our pain and problems are small compared to what is happening there. So we feel ashamed to even complain about checkpoints, settler violence and anything personal.</p>\n\n<p>How could I tell Ahmed about my fear of losing my mother, while he lost half of his family and friends - and couldn't even say goodbye to them or grieve?</p>\n\n<p>In the hospital, Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel lay side by side. But that is where co-existence ends. A big Star of David flag dominates the wall on the ward. Many visitors carry guns, their own private weapons.</p>\n\n<p>Afula is a small Israeli town, known as a hotbed of the extreme right. The mayor of Afula took part in a demonstration against the sale of a house to an Arab family. Among the demonstrators, who waved the flag of the Lehava organisation, were also the deputy mayor, Shlomo Malihi, and members of the city council.</p>\n\n<h3>Destruction of all moral values</h3>\n\n<p>Every morning when you arrive at the hospital and pass the security check, you cannot miss more than 100 stickers with the faces of soldiers killed in Gaza. There are stickers with the phrase \"We will win\" or \"With God's help we will win\".</p>\n\n<p>Whom, I wonder, does Israel want to defeat?</p>\n\n<p>Is it the 28-year-old Ahmed who holds his camera and dreams about a better life? Or Mariam Abu Dagga, who lost her mother in the war and hoped to see her only son graduating?</p>\n\n<div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\">\n  <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/mee-gaza-correspondent-mohammed-salama\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/Mohammed%20Salama%20Palestinian%20journalist%20Mohammed%20Salama%2C%20who%20Qatar-based%20Al%20Jazeera%20said%20worked%20for%20the%20broadcaster%2C%20and%20was%20killed%20in%20Israeli%20strikes%20on%20Nasser%20hospital%20on%20August%2025%2C%202025.jpg.webp?itok=_eXfCxTK\" width=\"400\" />\n\n</a>  <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">\u2018I cannot imagine our coverage without him\u2019:&nbsp;Tributes paid to MEE Gaza correspondent Mohamed Salama</div>\n    <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/mee-gaza-correspondent-mohammed-salama\">Read More \u00bb</a>\n</div>\n\n<p>Or is it those little faces and hands of starving children holding pots to get food?</p>\n\n<p>This genocide is not only destroying the fabric of our Palestinian life.

Application:</strong> The prospective state applies to the UN Secretary-General, currently <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/biography\">Antonio Guterres</a>, declaring it accepts the formal obligations of <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/about-us/about-un-membership\">UN membership</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>2 Recommendation: </strong>The prospective state then has to gain the approval of the UNSC,&nbsp;which has 15 members, five of which sit as permanent members. To clear this stage, the prospective state must be approved by nine of the 15 members, including all five permanent members.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>3. Acceptance: </strong>The applicant must then be accepted by a two-thirds majority of the 193-member UNGA, a number that Palestine has already exceeded.</p>\n\n<h3>Why does statehood matter to Palestinians?</h3>\n\n<p>For many Palestinians, global recognition of statehood and full admission to the UN would be a huge symbolic step towards serious international acknowledgement of their right to self-determination.</p>\n\n<p>Recognition would also confirm Palestine\u2019s status as a state under international law, meaning that other states would be obliged to respect its territorial integrity, borders and political independence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In practice, this means that any state recognising Palestine would need to revise its bilateral relations with Israel by clearly differentiating between Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, in line with existing obligations under <a

href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Israel</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">US</a>&nbsp;boycotted the conference.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the proceedings, the summit issued a joint statement and declaration, with most signatories from the West.</p>\n\n<p>Both documents condemned the attacks of 7 October, demanded an immediate ceasefire, the unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas, unhindered aid access and a Two-State Solution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Indent1\"><strong>The joint statement: </strong><a href=\"https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/israel-palestinian-territories/news/2025/article/israel-palestinian-territories-joint-statement-of-the-ministers-of-foreign-284968\">Issued on 29 July</a>, it said that the signatories \u201chave&nbsp;already recognized, have expressed or express the willingness or the positive consideration&nbsp;of our countries to recognize the State of Palestine, as an essential step towards the Two-State Solution, and invite all countries that have not done so to join this&nbsp;call\u201d.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing Indent1\">But the wording masked a range of interpretations of recognition. Some countries, such as Malta, said afterwards that they would recognise Palestine in September. But others, such as&nbsp;New Zealand and Finland, did not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing Indent1\"><strong>The declaration:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/israel-palestinian-territories/news/2025/article/united-nations-high-level-international-conference-new-york-declaration-on-the\">Signatories</a> to the declaration called for, among other things, Hamas to free all remaining hostages, end its rule in Gaza,&nbsp;and hand over its weapons to the PA.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing Indent1\">But again, several signatories, including Japan and Italy, did not put a date on when they would recognise Palestine.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3>How many countries have now recognised Palestine?</h3>\n\n<p>At the time of writing, the number of full UN members that formally recognise Palestine stands at 147 out of 193 - just over 75 percent.</p>\n\n<p>If recognition is not&nbsp;limited to UN members, then 149 states, including the Vatican, recognise Palestine, according to the Palestinian foreign ministry.</p>\n\n<p>These figures exclude France and other nations which have signalled intent, and whose formal recognition would push the figure beyond 80 percent.</p>\n\n<p>The picture is complicated by countries which have historically indicated support, but whose actions have since suggested&nbsp;otherwise, including Hungary and Papua New Guinea.</p>\n\n<h3>What happens next?</h3>\n\n<p>This year's annual UNGA begins on 9 September, with the general debate taking place from 23-29 September.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>All UN member states, as well as Palestine and the Holy See, are afforded at least one 15-minute opportunity to speak in the debate.

The head of Double Fine, a studio best known for the <em>Psychonauts</em> series, is trying to explain <em>Keeper</em>, a puzzle adventure game where you are, literally, a sentient, walking lighthouse. Double Fine is now one of several studios bought up by Microsoft and the team apparently took the opportunity to lean into all the resources available and, he said, \u201cmake something weird.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"c98731aa3a06421b8f61c74914b21ac8\"></div>\n<p>It\u2019s definitely that. The colors and atmosphere of <em>Keeper</em> have at least the touch of Psychonauts DNA. <em>Keeper</em> puts players in control of the aforementioned lighthouse, awakened (and joined) by a curious, occasionally aggressive, bird named Twig.  Interestingly, the lighthouse currently has no name.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Double Fine's art director, Lee Petty came up with the concept for the game, apparently inspired by his time spent hiking during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is reflected in a lot of ways, whether its the rolling hills and landscapes that the anthropomorphised lighthouse roams, or the fact that there\u2019s not a single word of dialogue. The interactions between the bird and building, which seem to pepper both cutscenes and gameplay, are like Pixar shorts.</p>\n<p>The environments have a drippy surrealist style to them to, and the lack of a map, health bar or any HUD at all means you\u2019re not distracted as you explore and solve puzzles.</p>\n<p>In some early gameplay footage, I saw how the lighthouse's main form of interaction comes from its light beam. Not only does this help you seek out pathways and objects, but it can also be focused on the countless skittering creatures. Sometimes this causes creatures to flee, while other times they\u2019ll offer up magical orbs willingly and unwillingly, which open up later areas or bring towering creatures (structures?) to life. In Double Fine fashion, things look weird, too, with melted mountain peaks with more than a dost of Dali.</p>\n<p>You don't <em>have</em> to attack everything, either. During three different gameplay demos, I watched all kinds of creatures hide, run, and just exist in this world where humanity has long since disappeared. Oh there\u2019s briefly a giant flying whale too.</p>\n<p>Using the lighthouse\u2019s beam on certain things will leave an twinkling spark behind, meaning that Twig the bird can interact with it. During a later segment, the lighthouse can manipulate time, turning its bird companion back into an egg while a building repairs itself \u2014 and frees up a pathway. Twig remains an egg for a while until later, when the lighthouse can fast-forward time. Abilities like this seem location-dependent, rather than a Metroidvania collection of skills built up over the game. At another juncture, the lighthouse walks into a cloud of pink fluffy mist, unlocking the ability to jump and float around levels.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Keeper\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/0bf037f0-7e93-11f0-953b-dcafdb975057\" style=\"height: 1358px; width: 2436px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Double Fine</div></figure>\n<p>Schafer says the themes of life-changing and metamorphosis will continue to bubble up during<em> Keeper </em>and<em>&nbsp;</em>the lighthouse and bird duo is clearly central to all of it. It reminds me a little of <em>Banjo Kazooie</em> (the latter was a bird) but also <em>Ico</em>; at one point, the seemingly impervious lighthouse loses its footing, but Twig willfully tries to drag their partner to safety. Did Twig even help? Maybe not, but the sentiment was there.</p>\n<p><em>Keeper </em>will launch on Xbox Series S|X and PC on October 17th, including Xbox Game Pass.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/doublefine-keeper-gameplay-gamescom2025-123038715.html?src=rss"}
