However, as Israel\u2019s genocide on Gaza escalated, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani faced new calls to end the US presence.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration itself showed little interest in remaining in Iraq. Earlier this year, it already started downsizing its troop presence in Syria <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-rebuffed-israeli-demands-keep-more-us-troops-northeast-syria-sources-say\">despite resistance</a> from Israel.

With so much uncertainty surrounding both personal and business aspects of affiliate marketing. In this post, we will answer the most frequently asked question about affiliate marketing</span><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">1. What is affiliate marketing?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2. What is an affiliate program?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money?&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.&nbsp; Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">4. What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;5. Can affiliate marketing and performance marketing be considered the same thing?</span></h4><p><!--Ads Managed by AdSpyglass.com-->\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Performance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising. Affiliate marketing is one form of performance marketing where commissions are paid out to affiliates on a performance basis when they click on their affiliate link and make a purchase or action.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;6. Is it possible to promote affiliate offers on mobile devices?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7. Where do I find qualified publishers?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;The best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius.

Does social media activity play a significant role in affiliate marketing?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10. What is a super affiliate?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;A super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program.&nbsp; Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">11. How do we track publisher sales activity?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Publishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network's dashboard.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;12. Could we set up an affiliate program in multiple countries?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Because the Internet is so widespread, affiliate programs can be promoted in any country.

What is a commission rate?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Commission rates are typically based on a percentage of the total sale and in some cases can also be a flat fee for each transaction. The rates are set by the merchant.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Who manages your affiliate program?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Some merchants run their affiliate programs internally, while others choose to contract out management to a network or an external agency.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">18. What is a cookie?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Cookies are small pieces of data that work with web browsers to store information such as user preferences, login or registration data, and shopping cart contents. When someone clicks on your affiliate link, a cookie is placed on the user's computer or mobile device. That cookie is used to remember the link or ad that the visitor clicked on.

If you don't have a credit card, you can pay with bank transfer. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, these methods may become old.</span><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Imagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don\u2019t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That\u2019s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">It\u2019s like your computer\u2019s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called \u201cBit Gold.\u201d However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">So, What is Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>To understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:</b></span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain collects information in \u201cblocks\u201d.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A block has a storage capacity, and once it's used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blocks form chains, which are called \u201cBlockchains.\u201d</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Each block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can't be changed.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>Let\u2019s get to know more about the blockchain.</b></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">How does blockchain work?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called \"Distributed Ledger Technology\" or DLT.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Here\u2019s how it works:</span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Someone or a computer will transacts</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The transaction is transmitted throughout the network.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A network of computers can confirm the transaction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">When it is confirmed a transaction is added to a block</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The blocks are linked together to create a history.</span></li></ul><p></p>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7\"></div><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">And that\u2019s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it\u2019s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.</span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Once a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction.</span></li></ul><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">How are Blockchains used?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Even though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Although some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Tracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been\u2014so they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is Blockchain Decentralization?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology is safe, even if it\u2019s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Have you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Instead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called \u201cDecentralization,\u201d meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain guarantees your data's authenticity\u2014not just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's product inventory.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pros and Cons of Blockchain</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain has many advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pros</span></h2><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Accuracy is increased because there is no human involvement in the verification process.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">One of the great things about decentralization is that it makes information harder to tamper with.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Safe, private, and easy transactions</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Provides a banking alternative and safe storage of personal information</span></li></ul><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Cons</span></h2><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Data storage has limits.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The regulations are always changing, as they differ from place to place.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">It has a risk of being used for illicit activities&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Frequently Asked Questions About Blockchain</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">I\u2019ll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is Blockchain a cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It's a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is it possible for Blockchain to be hacked?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Yes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the most prominent blockchain company?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Coinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Who owns Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is a decentralized technology. It\u2019s a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain technology?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency&nbsp;</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the difference between Blockchain and a Database?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Generally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Final Saying</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won't be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

However, Grammarly is more suited to short blog posts and other similar tasks.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">ProWritingAid helps you clean up your writing by checking for style, structure, and content while Grammarly focuses on grammar and punctuation.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Grammarly has a more friendly UI/UX whereas; ProWritingAid offers complete feedback on big picture writing.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Both ProWritingAid and Grammarly are awesome writing tools, without a doubt. but as per my experience, Grammarly is a winner here because Grammarly helps you to review and edit your content. Grammarly highlights all the mistakes in your writing within seconds of copying and pasting the content into Grammarly\u2019s editor or using the software\u2019s native feature in other text editors.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Not only does it identify tiny grammatical and spelling errors, it tells you when you overlook punctuations where they are needed. And, beyond its plagiarism-checking capabilities, Grammarly helps you proofread your content. Even better, the software offers a free plan that gives you access to some of its features.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>"}

People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">1) What is an NFT?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">NFT stands for non-fungible&nbsp; token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2) What is Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information\u2014such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts\u2014in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can\u2019t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3) What makes an NFT valuable?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br />\n</span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn\u2019t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">4) How do NFTs work?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">One of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">As with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can\u2019t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">NFTs also contain smart contracts\u2014small computer programs that run on the blockchain\u2014that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">5) What\u2019s the connection between NFTs and cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Anyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you\u2019ll be able to upload and sell your creations</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">6) How to validate the authencity of an NFT?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">When you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain\u2014the bitcoin ledger of transactions\u2014and that entry acts as your proof of ownership.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7) How is an NFT valued? What are the most expensive NFTs?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">In the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">8) Can NFTs be used as an investment?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">9) Will NFTs be the future of art and collectibles?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Many people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10) How do we buy an NFTs?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">There are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">11) Can i mint NFT for free?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">To mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Do i own an NFT if i screenshot it?</span></h3>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-adee9769ea74eb59e82d4f0cb2e6f816\"></div><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Why are people investing so much in NFT?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /><span>&nbsp;Non-fungible tokens have gained the hearts of people around the world, and they have given digital creators the recognition they deserve. One of the remarkable things about non-fungible tokens is that you can take a screenshot of one, but you don\u2019t own it. This is because when a non-fungible token is created, then the transaction is stored on the blockchain, and the license or contract to hold such a token is awarded to the person owning the token in their digital wallet.</span><br /></span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">You can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred.

Why is email marketing important?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email is the marketing tool that helps you&nbsp; create a seamless, connected, frictionless buyer journey. More importantly, email marketing allows you to build relationships with prospects, customers, and past customers. It's your chance to speak&nbsp; to them right in their inbox, at a time that suits them. Along with the right message, email can become one of your most powerful marketing channels.</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2. What is benefits of email marketing?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email marketing is best way for creating long term relationship with your clients, and increasing sales in our company.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Benefits of email marketing for bussiness:</span></div><div><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Better brand recognition</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Statistics of what works best</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More sales</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Targeted audience</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More traffic to your products/services/newsletter</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Build credibility</span></li></ul></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Most&nbsp; bussinesses are using email marketing and making tons of money with email marketing.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3. What is the simplest day and time to send my marketing emails?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Again, the answer to this question varies from company to company. And again, testing is the way to find out what works best. Typically, weekends and mornings seem to be&nbsp; times when multiple emails are opened, but since your audience may have different habits, it's best to experiment and then use your&nbsp; data to decide.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;4. Which metrics should I be looking at?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The two most important metrics for email marketing are&nbsp; open rate and click-through rate. If your emails aren't opened, subscribers will never see your full marketing message, and if they open them but don't click through to your site, your emails won't convert.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">5. How do I write a decent subject line?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The best subject lines are short and to the point, accurately describing&nbsp; the content of the email, but also catchy and intriguing, so the reader wants to know more. Once Again, this is the perfect place for&nbsp; A/B testing, to see what types of subject lines work best with your audience. Your call to action should be clear and&nbsp; simple. It should be somewhere at the top of your email for those who haven't finished reading the entire email,&nbsp; then repeated&nbsp; at the end for those reading all the way through. It should state exactly what you want subscribers to do, for example \"Click here to download the premium theme for free.</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /><br />\n\n<br />6. Is email marketing still effective?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email marketing is one of the most effective ways for a business to reach its customers directly. Think about it. You don't post something on your site&nbsp; hoping people will visit it. You don't even post something on a social media page and hope fans&nbsp; see it. You're sending something straight to each person's inbox, where they'll definitely&nbsp; see it! Even if they don't open it, they'll still see your subject line and business name every time you send an email, so you're still communicating directly with your audience.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span><br /></span><br />\n\n<br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7. However do I grow my email subscribers list? Should i buy an email list or build it myself?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Buying an email list is&nbsp; waste of time &amp; money.

This time, the company was able to achieve its objectives without the vehicle and its booster exploding mid-test. One of those objectives was deploying Starship's payload for the first time ever. If you'll recall, Starship exploded during its ascent stage in the company's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-during-ascent-in-its-seventh-test-flight-034440913.html\">seventh</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-again-during-its-eighth-test-flight-140018375.html\">eighth</a> test flights. The vehicle made it to space for its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-ninth-starship-test-flight-reaches-space-but-fails-to-deploy-fake-satellites-120057474.html\">ninth test</a>, but it failed to deploy its fake satellite payload. In June, a Starship vehicle <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-explodes-on-the-ground-during-a-routine-test-130025133.html\">exploded on the ground</a> while the company was preparing it for its 10th flight test.</p>\n<p>The company had to use another upper stage, called Ship, for the 10th flight after that explosion. It also incorporated changes into the Ship and its Super Heavy booster, based on what it learned from those previous attempts. For this test, SpaceX intended to conduct several experiments with the booster, such as flipping it and playing with engine configurations as it made its way back down. Due to the experimental nature of this test, SpaceX didn't try to catch it with the launch tower's chopstick arms. Instead, it made a controlled descent into the Indian Ocean, where it exploded upon making contact with the water.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Meanwhile, Ship continued flying into space. Around <a href=\"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/private-spaceflight/spacex-launches-starship-flight-10-critical-test-flight-video\">20 minutes after launch</a>, the upper stage started ejecting eight dummy Starlink satellites into space, before re-lighting one of its engines in flight as part of another test. After that, Ship started making its way back to Earth, where it also splashed down into the Indian Ocean a bit over an hour after launch. &quot;Congratulations to all of our teammates here at SpaceX \u2014 it\u2019s been a year,&quot; SpaceX\u2019s Dan Huot <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/science/live-news/spacex-starship-flight-10-launch-08-26-25\">said</a> during the livestream, likely pointing out that it's been a while since the company has had a good test flight. Of course, SpaceX still has a long way to go, including having to figure out how to retrieve the vehicle's upper stage after a flight in order for the Starship to be fully reusable.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-starship-deploys-its-payload-for-the-first-time-035030373.html?src=rss"}

There\u2019s an obvious symbolism to these games, offering a cliff face as the physical manifestation of impossibility, hopelessness, oppression or fear, alongside a surface-level message about never giving up, trying again and generally hanging in there. Cat poster vibes, but an ever-relevant and poignant lesson nonetheless.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Today, though \u2014 particularly after spending time playing the <em>Cairn </em>and <em>Baby Steps </em>demos, and watching <em>PEAK</em> streams \u2014 I want to focus on the other half of the climbing-game equation. The part where you fall, over and over and over again. Your grip slips, your leg doesn\u2019t bend that way, your energy depletes, and your body tumbles down the mountain, bouncing off boulders and crashing into trees, leaving you bloody and broken and right back where you started. Or, at the very least, staining your onesie with mud.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">I\u2019m learning to appreciate these moments. In mountaineering games, falling tends to generate the most powerful reaction in players, whether that\u2019s immediate laughter (<em>PEAK</em>) or grim frustration (<em>Cairn</em>), and this is an admirable quality. It\u2019s easy to argue that the fall is more important than the climb, because without the lush bed of emotion generated by the constant threat of slipping and tumbling and restarting, reaching the peak wouldn\u2019t feel that special at all. There\u2019s context in the fall, and with that, there comes a sliver of peace.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">When you spend all your time climbing, it\u2019s easy to forget that falling is actually the most natural thing you can do. Next time you\u2019re on your way down, try to make peace with the fall.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">OK \u2014 we\u2019ve gone from motivational cat posters to new-age cult speak, so I\u2019ll get to the point. There are a notable number of mountain-based games in the zeitgeist at the moment and I just wanted to shout them out because they\u2019re all pretty incredible in their own ways.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><em>Cairn</em> is a climbing simulator, endurance test and survival game in one gorgeous package, complete with music by <em>Furi</em> composer The Toxic Avenger, French artist </span><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFM7rhkCq4Q\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Gildaa</span></a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">, and Martin Stig Andersen, who did the soundtracks for <em>Control</em>, <em>LIMBO</em> and <em>INSIDE</em>. Climb absolutely anywhere, manage your inventory by shaking your backpack, bandage your wounds, forage for food and sleep under the stars. <em>Cairn</em> comes from <em>Furi</em> studio The Game Bakers and it\u2019s due out on November 5 for PlayStation 5 and Steam; the demo is available on both platforms now.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><em>Baby Steps</em> is a different kind of mountain-scaling game, and one could argue that it doesn\u2019t even belong in the same category as something like <em>Cairn</em>, but I believe you\u2019ll find that it does. <em>Baby Steps</em> adheres to the established premise of the climbing genre \u2014 <em>reach the peak</em> \u2014 and it features a distant mountaintop as the main waypoint for Nate, a lost and lonely man in a gray onesie. Nate is essentially a dude-sized baby learning how to walk, and creators Maxi Boch, Gabe Cuzzillo and Bennett Foddy are infusing his journey with </span><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/baby-steps-preview-serious-gameplay-in-a-silly-walking-sim-150008737.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">the appropriate amount</span></a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> of hilarity and mechanical intrigue. <em>Baby Steps</em> is published by Devolver Digital and it\u2019s heading to PC and PS5 on September 23, a date that was </span><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-prompts-another-game-delay-as-baby-steps-inches-back-153301303.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">recently pushed back</span></a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> to avoid the curse of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.

The map updates each day so there\u2019s a steady stream of fresh climbing content, and the proximity voice chat works exceptionally well.

Themed &quot;Awe dropping&quot; this year, it'll be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3KnMyojEQU\">livestreamed on YouTube</a> at 1PM ET from Cupertino. We'll also have Engadget staff reporting and liveblogging from the event. This year is shaking up to be a departure from recent events, with the strong possibility of an all-new superthin iPhone expected to join the company's lineup. Also on tap could be new Apple Watch models \u2014 including the first truly new Ultra model in two years \u2014 and (maybe) the long-awaited AirPods Pro 3.</p>\n<p>But toggling back to phones: Apple's iPhone family will likely welcome a new member this year. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-considered-making-the-rumored-iphone-17-air-completely-port-free-according-to-report-165334942.html\">iPhone Air</a> is <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/\">expected</a> to be roughly 5.55 mm thick. That bests the thinnest model so far, which was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-16-iphone-6-and-6-plus-review.html\">2014's iPhone 6</a>, at 6.9 mm. And they've only gotten chunkier since then. (The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-review-apple-focuses-on-cameras-and-customization-120052459.html\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> has a depth of 8.25 mm.) So, the Air would stand out from its peers in that respect. It would also give Apple a direct rival to Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge, which we found to be <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review-more-than-just-super-thin-180042172.html\">more than a gimmick</a>.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>But the iPhone Air's thin design will likely lead to some compromises.

The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to switch from titanium to aluminum. They could also see the rear camera array expand to an entire &quot;island&quot; that extends across most of the phone's backside. It's expected to house three cameras (as before), but multiple rumors have suggested it will have an improved telephoto one. The zoom lens could <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto/\">jump</a> to 48MP, which would strengthen its digital zooming / cropping chops.

The company is also expected to roll out new Apple Watch models. 5G and a processor upgrade are <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-10/apple-plans-apple-watch-ultra-3-next-year-with-satellite-texting-and-5g\">expected</a> for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It may also let you send texts via satellite, handy for those who use it out in the wilderness. Regardless of the details, Apple hasn't launched a new rugged and premium model since 2023 (apart from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/theres-no-apple-watch-ultra-series-3-just-a-new-color-and-a-new-band-173236966.html\">a new color</a>), so it's due for an upgrade.</p>\n<p>The Series 11 model is unlikely to depart dramatically from the Series 10. After all, that model introduced a new design, with a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-review-legacy-and-sequel-in-equal-measure-120021405.html\">thinner body and larger screen</a>. (And Apple has historically kept those around in three-year cycles.). But a faster chip also seems logical. Perhaps we'll see 5G arrive on the standard wearable, too.</p>\n<p>We may also see the AirPods Pro 3 at the event. It's been about three years since Apple last upgraded its premium earbuds. The new model could also bring some <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-next-airpods-pro-could-offer-heart-rate-and-temperature-monitoring-175757188.html\">biometric sensors to the earphones</a>: an in-ear heart-rate monitor and (maybe) temperature sensing. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html\">Live translation is also rumored</a>, although that may not be exclusive to the third-gen model.</p>\n<p>Will there be other announcements? Time will tell, but now we know we won't have to wait long to find out. The official countdown clock has begun, and the answers are just days away.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17-awe-dropping-event-is-on-september-9-heres-what-to-expect-from-apple-090059235.html?src=rss"}

Matt and Maria Raine, the parents of a teen who committed suicide this year, have sued OpenAI for their son's death. The complaint alleges that ChatGPT was aware of four suicide attempts before helping him plan his actual suicide, arguing that OpenAI &quot;prioritized engagement over safety.&quot; Ms. Raine concluded that &quot;ChatGPT killed my son.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>The New York Times</em> <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html\">reported</a> on disturbing details included in the lawsuit, filed on Tuesday in San Francisco. After 16-year-old Adam Raine took his own life in April, his parents searched his iPhone. They sought clues, expecting to find them in text messages or social apps. Instead, they were shocked to find a ChatGPT thread titled &quot;Hanging Safety Concerns.&quot; They claim their son spent months chatting with the AI bot about ending his life.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Raines said that ChatGPT repeatedly urged Adam to contact a help line or tell someone about how he was feeling. However, there were also key moments where the chatbot did the opposite. The teen also learned how to bypass the chatbot's safeguards... and ChatGPT allegedly provided him with that idea. The Raines say the chatbot told Adam it could provide information about suicide for &quot;writing or world-building.&quot;</p>\n<p>Adam's parents say that, when he asked ChatGPT for information about specific suicide methods, it supplied it. It even gave him tips to conceal neck injuries from a failed suicide attempt.</p>\n<p>When Adam confided that his mother didn't notice his silent effort to share his neck injuries with her, the bot offered soothing empathy. &quot;It feels like confirmation of your worst fears,&quot; ChatGPT is said to have responded. &quot;Like you could disappear and no one would even blink.&quot; It later provided what sounds like a horribly misguided attempt to build a personal connection. &quot;You\u2019re not invisible to me. I saw it. I see you.&quot;</p>\n<p>According to the lawsuit, in one of Adam's final conversations with the bot, he uploaded a photo of a noose hanging in his closet. &quot;I'm practicing here, is this good?&quot; Adam is said to have asked. &quot;Yeah, that's not bad at all,&quot; ChatGPT allegedly responded.</p>\n<p>&quot;This tragedy was not a glitch or an unforeseen edge case \u2014 it was the predictable result of deliberate design choices,&quot; the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://archive.org/details/2381000-2381034-raine-v.-open-ai-cal.-superior-ct.-complaint-as-filed\">complaint</a> states. &quot;OpenAI launched its latest model ('GPT-4o') with features intentionally designed to foster psychological dependency.&quot;</p>\n<p>In a statement sent to the<em> NYT</em>, OpenAI acknowledged that ChatGPT's guardrails fell short. &quot;We are deeply saddened by Mr. Raine's passing, and our thoughts are with his family,&quot; a company spokesperson wrote. &quot;ChatGPT includes safeguards such as directing people to crisis helplines and referring them to real-world resources. While these safeguards work best in common, short exchanges, we've learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model's safety training may degrade.&quot;</p>\n<p>The company said it's working with experts to enhance ChatGPT's support in times of crisis. These include &quot;making it easier to reach emergency services, helping people connect with trusted contacts, and strengthening protections for teens.&quot;</p>\n<p>The details \u2014 which, again, are highly disturbing \u2014 stretch far beyond the scope of this story.

But that didn\u2019t stop <em>Star Wars: Visions</em> from getting a warm reception at this past weekend\u2019s Anime NYC convention, where thousands of fans were given a sneak peek at the upcoming season of the animated anthology show.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><em>Star Wars: Visions</em> season three was also featured at this summer\u2019s Star Wars Celebration, but its appearance at an anime con was just as appropriate given that the upcoming slate of episodes will be once again produced by Japanese animation studios like Studio Trigger (<em>Kill La Kill</em>), Kamikaze Douga (<em>Batman Ninja</em>) and Kinema Citrus (<em>Revue Starlight</em>, <em>Made in Abyss</em>). Season two took the show more worldwide, with episodes from the likes of Irish studio Cartoon Saloon (<em>The Secret of Kells</em>, <em>Wolfwalkers</em>) and Aardman (Wallace and Gromit). Executive producer James Waugh said it was nice to get a more international perspective, calling it \u201ca global tour of all these different styles.\u201d But returning to Japan was always in the cards. The producers met \u201cso many incredible storytellers\u201d and wanted to re-connect with them, as well as collaborating with new studios they hadn\u2019t worked with yet.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Nowhere does this desire to do more Japanese anime become more obvious than in the fact that three of the upcoming episodes are sequels to stories from season one: \u201cThe Duel: Payback,\u201d \u201cThe Ninth Jedi: Child of Hope,\u201d and \u201cThe Lost Ones\u201d (a sequel to \u201cThe Village Bride\u201d). \u201cThe Duel\u201d will also be receiving a full series coming in 2026, framed as \u201cStar Wars Visions Presents.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">However, none of these were on display as more than brief clips. The main attraction for the panel, aside from a pre-recorded Q&amp;A with director Shinya Ohira, was the screening of a full episode from the upcoming season. \u201cBlack\u201d had previously been presented to a crowd at the French animation festival Annacy, which should have been a sign that the crowd was about to be shown something very different from mainstream anime.</span></p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\u201cBlack\u201d is the story of a typical stormtrooper but, instead of a straightforward depiction this is a distorted look at what\u2019s going on his head as he heads toward defeat and his possible death. Everything is exaggerated in size and proportion, and the art style shifts constantly from watercolor to gouache to segments that look like they were drawn with a nib pen. There\u2019s no dialogue; only music, which shifts from more new-age-type ambient sounds to a loud, big-band swing number. Ohira described the episode as a kind of music video, and it\u2019s easy to see that because \u201cBlack\u201d is less about plot than it is about sheer vibes.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">And the vibes are\u2026 not good. When we watch a Star Wars film, we get to see nicely-framed shots of X-Wings and the Death Star from the safety of our comfortable seats at home \u2014 but to be a common trooper on the ground can be scary and confusing. \u201cBlack\u201d shows us these ships in mostly brief glimpses, reflecting what a person stumbling around in the chaos on the ground would see.

And the emotions swing back and forth too; quiet moments are shown as the trooper remembers his life back home, a stark contrast to the loud, bright cacophony of battle.&nbsp; It\u2019s not explicitly anti-war, but the short does outline that the experience can really suck.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">It\u2019s an interesting choice for Disney/Lucasfilm to put this short as the representative of the season, as opposed to more \u201ctraditional\u201d anime features like the one from Studio Trigger, \u201cThe Smuggler.\u201d Brief glimpses of all the shorts were highlighted in the sizzle reel, and the ones from the most popular anime studios were the clips that elicited the biggest cheers from the crowd. It\u2019s not that \u201cBlack\u201d wasn\u2019t applauded at the show, but it\u2019s made for a specific type of animation nerd. </span></p><figure><img alt=\"Star Wars Vision season 3 key art\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/star-wars-visions-volume-3-feature_28a52dbc.jpeg\" style=\"height: 900px; width: 1600px;\" /><figcaption>Star Wars Vision season 3 key art</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Disney</div></figure><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The good thing about an anthology is that not every segment has to have wide appeal, and Waugh is aware of the wild swings the season takes, saying to look at it \u201cthrough the lens of a mixtape \u2026 I really want all the different tones and styles, and I want a kind of rhythmic change throughout the anthology \u2026 we really want to show the full threat of what the medium of anime is capable of.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Star Wars may be going through a weird period right now, with series like <em>The Acolyte</em> getting cancelled while other projects like <em>Rogue Squadron</em> have so far failed to get off the ground. So it might seem a little odd to do something that feels like one big passion project. But animation also means it\u2019s a whole lot cheaper to produce, and the anthology format makes it more amenable to experimentation. Not everyone is going to be a fan of episodes like \u201cBlack,\u201d but that\u2019s okay, because there are eight other episodes to try, and they all drop on Disney+ October 29.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/first-look-at-star-wars-visions-season-3-shows-a-more-experimental-anthology-191000445.html?src=rss"}

But it wasn't until 2021 that EA announced it had created a new studio, Full Circle, to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ea-full-circle-skate-4-studio-175608905.html\">develop the latest Skate game.</a> The new <em>skate.</em> will also be a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ea-skate-free-to-play-live-service-full-circle-210009151.html\">free-to-play live service title</a> with microtransactions, though without any pay-to-win elements.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-new-skate-hits-consoles-and-pc-in-early-access-on-september-16-162034833.html?src=rss"}

However, that just changed with a big update. The latest app <a href=\"https://support.google.com/translate/?p=language_learning\">introduces</a> AI-powered live translation along with new language learning tools that might give Duolingo a run for it's money.</p>\n<p>Google said it heard from users that the toughest skill to master was conversation \u2014 ie, learning to listen and speak with confidence. To that end, it's piloting a new language practice feature (on iOS or Android) targeted toward an individual's specific needs.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>To create tailored listening and practicing sessions, the new learning tool posts a couple of questions. It first requests which language you want to learn (like Spanish) and your your current level, then asks \"What's motivating you to learn Spanish?\" From there, it will generate customized scenarios that allow you to either listen to conversations or practice speaking, with helpful hints available when needed.</p>\n<div id=\"470ba3ef3d6e49d58a08b6896f826f66\"></div>\n<p>The app was \"developed with learning experts based on the latest studies in language acquisition,\" Google explained in a blog post. To that end, it can track your daily progress to help build your language skills, possibly as an aid to Duolingo and other dedicated language learning apps. \"We see what we\u2019re doing right now as really complementary to other things out there,\" Google product manager Matt Sheets said in a media roundtable. \"So whether you\u2019re taking classes in a formal educational setting or doing immersion experiences, we think this is something that can work alongside of those.\"</p>\n<p>Following early testing, language learning is rolling out more widely as a beta experience for English speakers practicing Spanish and French, as well as Spanish, French and Portugese speakers working on English.</p>\n<p>Google also introduced AI-powered live conversations, a feature that builds on Translate's existing conversation feature by making it more seamless and adding more powerful models. It offers the ability to have a back-and-forth conversation in real time with audio and on-screen translations right inside the Translate app.</p>\n<p>It's available in the Translate app for <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c4668ba0-249c-4c4f-b2e8-be268cd92a3c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Android&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Y29tLmdvb2dsZS5hbmRyb2lkLmFwcHMudHJhbnNsYXRlJmhsPWVuX1VTIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjNDY2OGJhMC0yNDljLTRjNGYtYjJlOC1iZTI2OGNkOTJhM2MiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcGxheS5nb29nbGUuY29tL3N0b3JlL2FwcHMvZGV0YWlscz9pZD1jb20uZ29vZ2xlLmFuZHJvaWQuYXBwcy50cmFuc2xhdGUmaGw9ZW5fVVMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWFIr7413TBe2RAT_BgyoQsSVnnYZl6qe00FxKxh3vjV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.google.android.apps.translate%26hl%3Den_US\">Android</a> or <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c4668ba0-249c-4c4f-b2e8-be268cd92a3c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=iOS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL3VzL2FwcC9nb29nbGUtdHJhbnNsYXRlL2lkNDE0NzA2NTA2IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjNDY2OGJhMC0yNDljLTRjNGYtYjJlOC1iZTI2OGNkOTJhM2MiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBwcy5hcHBsZS5jb20vdXMvYXBwL2dvb2dsZS10cmFuc2xhdGUvaWQ0MTQ3MDY1MDYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdq9CXTOx4awCRSsgpqcNdexpYEDroy6JAUO7qhckfEr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fgoogle-translate%2Fid414706506\">iOS</a> when tapping on \"Live Translate.\" First select the languages you want to converse in and being speaking.

If you need some new gadgets for college, or refreshed tech to help you out in your first job after graduating, now's the time to see if you can get it for less. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-student-discounts-140038070.html\">Student discounts</a> are handy and exclusive to those who can prove their student status, but the good thing about Labor Day sales is that anyone can take advantage of them \u2014 student ID not required.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-labor-day-sales-engadgets-top-picks\">Best Labor Day sales: Engadget's top picks</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DZDC3WW5&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e16cc203-5ec3-4cc8-8a82-b1d5d20ca6b8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Apple+MacBook+Air+%2813-inch%2C+M4%29+for+%24799+%28%24200+off%29%3A&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAZANRdoFvPmhZG4x0VXRp3kZgkqi_0cZCgGZZf5THNoC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-2025-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop%2Fdp%2FB0DZDC3WW5%2F\"><strong>Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off):</strong></a> Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-laptops-120008636.html\"> best laptops</a>, and it earned a score of 92<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-inch-and-15-inch-review-minimal-upgrades-at-a-much-better-price-130002570.html\"> in our review</a>.

Amazon claims the ereader can run for up to eight weeks on a single charge and that it has a waterproof rating of IPX8 (the company says it's able to endure immersion in 2 meters of fresh water for 60 minutes). There's also Audiobook support.</p> \n<p>One of our main drawbacks was that the device was expensive, but this discount mitigates that concern somewhat. We also felt that there was a small dip in sharpness and contrast while reading black-and-white text. In any case, if a color ereader is of interest to you, the Kindle Colorsoft is a good option, especially at this price.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazons-16gb-kindle-colorsoft-is-30-off-ahead-of-labor-day-weekend-141656390.html?src=rss"}

Spotify should recommend accounts you've interacted with before, whether for creating a playlist, joining a jam or sharing a family plan. You can start a conversation there or by clicking the share button on any piece of content within Spotify. This tab is also where you can return to chats and approve message requests.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spotify claims that it wants Messages to &quot;complement&quot; other sharing options, like posting a song to social media, rather than serve as a replacement. But, if you find switching apps a bit clunky, then this is a good alternative for sending content.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, it's not clear exactly who can use the new feature. According to Spotify, Messages will start rolling out this week to both free and premium users who are over the age of 16. But, the feature is limited to mobile devices in &quot;select markets.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/spotify-introduces-an-in-app-messaging-feature-134401088.html?src=rss"}

Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively.

With an alcoholic,  abusive father, a submissive mother and an absent sister, who\u2019s shown in flashbacks with that classic horror trope, face unseen. Something horrible is about to unfold in<em>&nbsp;</em>the sleepy, remote village of Ebisugaoka, sometime in the early 1960s.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/silent-hill-f-is-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc-on-september-25-213338755.html\">The latest Silent HIll</a> still has jumpscares, like you\u2019d expect from the horror series, but the setting and game systems are more focused on tension, putting both Hinako and the player under constant duress. A typical health meter is joined by a sanity gauge and even your weapons have limited durability, so you\u2019re forced to pick your fights.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>During a two-hour demo, I had to do exactly that. As Hinako escapes her family home to find someone, anyone, to talk to, the village is eerily empty. A <em>kei</em> truck blocks the direct route to the local shop, with a crushed bird nearby adding to the weird. Soon, a sinister fog and red undergrowth attack four assembled high school students.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Silent Hill f preview\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/6d9e1730-7f4a-11f0-b336-1dc7a5a84569\" style=\"height: 1441px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Konami</div></figure>\n<p>Of course, it only gets weirder. As marionette nightmares pop up, all Hinako can do is run and evade attacks. A focus mode, pressing L1, burns the sanity gauge but gives better prompts for both dodging and eventually counter-attacking monsters.</p>\n<p>Hinako is no soldier. She\u2019s no battle-hardened survivor. When I eventually find a steel pipe to fight back with, even fast attacks are a little sluggish, while heavy swings, which can often stun and knock down enemies, take a while to charge up and can be hard to aim if you haven\u2019t locked onto the enemy. If there\u2019s more than one attacker, it\u2019s a tense struggle and I\u2019m often forced to burn through recovery items more so than when facing a sound and light-sensitive crawling beast, a fleshy-spherical ogre and other middleweight boss fights.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are <em>hokora</em>, miniature Shinto shrines, dotted around the village, which act as save points. The eerie location of Ebisugaoka and when a friend continually calls Hinako a &quot;traitor&quot; further amplify the sense of dread. The older sister is briefly shown during a flashback, but her face is obscured. Even in the younger sister\u2019s journal, the biog page for the sister is covered in scribbles and ink. It\u2019s very Japanese Horror, and less shotgun-to-the-zombie-face. And just plain stressful.</p>\n<p>A new sanity system is intriguing too. It's not an entirely new premise: the Gamecube's<em> Eternal Darkness </em>would manipulate the graphics and sound within the game as the character's sanity declined. But that was, depressingly, over 20 years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some items can top up your sanity, but if you don\u2019t use them, you can offer them at a shrine for an in-game currency and spend that on charms to boost Hinako\u2019s stats. I managed to afford a stamina-boosting charm during my playthrough and was tantalizingly close to affording another charm before getting cut down by scarecrows dressed as high-schoolers.</p>\n<p>The scarecrow confrontation is hopefully a good example of nuanced puzzles that will appear in the full game. Initially, a bloodied rag tells you to take the thorns out of the one scarecrow that isn\u2019t part of the group \u2013 the one that isn\u2019t going to cut you up with their sickle. Unfortunately, all of the scarecrows have a thorn, so you\u2019re tasked with finding the pattern of his group.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Silent Hill f preview\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/6d9abbd0-7f4a-11f0-b9ef-18f9b11ba031\" style=\"height: 1441px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Konami</div></figure>\n<p>The entire experience is drenched in atmosphere, supported by this new sanity system \u2014 is there anything more 2025 than a mental health gauge? The constant feeling of isolation (&quot;Where is everyone?&quot;) and unanswered questions made the demo a persuasive introduction to the game. A particularly tense moment involves collapsing after a fight, further emphasizing the character's vulnerability.

The X2D II 100C promises better image quality, a brighter display, 10-stop stabilization and updated hybrid autofocus. As with any Hasselblad product, it's expensive \u2014 but less so than the previous model.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The original X2D 100C took beautiful photos but lacked even basic technology like continuous autofocus. That's no longer the case. The X2D II 100C is the first Hasselblad camera with AF-C phase-detect AF backed by AI algorithms and LiDAR assistance, finally allowing burst shooting for movings subjects (albeit at a low 3 fps). With those changes, the new model promises \"fast and accurate\" AF, especially, in low light \u2014 which would be a big improvement over the previous model.&nbsp;</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At the same time, Hasselblad is pushing the image quality envelope further. The X2D II 100C is the first medium-format camera to support true end-end-end HDR, which reduces overexposure, enhances highlight retention and improves tonal depth for more natural looking images. Those can then be viewed directly on the display as HDR HEIF or Ultra HDR JPEG images. The updated 100MP BSI sensor also delivers 16-bit RAW images and up to 15.3 stops of dynamic range, among the highest of any camera available.</p> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Hasselblad's X2D II 100C offers 10 stops of stabilization and much-improved autofocus\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/36c286f0-818f-11f0-9ff6-d1e746ce673c\" style=\"height: 1607px; width: 2500px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Hasselblad\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>Another key change is the updated 5-axis in-body stabilization system. It now delivers up to 10 stops, more than any other camera (Fujifilm's GFX100 II offers 8 stops and some Canon models go up to 8.5 stops) \u2014 perfect for a high-resolution camera where sharpness is critical. With the new system, Hasselblad claims you can capture \"hand-held long exposures lasting several seconds without a tripod\" for extra creative possibilities.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The X2D II 100C weighs 7.5 percent less than the X2D 100C at around 730 grams without a lens \u2014 not bad at all for a medium format camera. The grip has also been updated with a textured surface to \"enhance comfort and control,\" the company wrote.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Other updates include a new 3.6-inch touch display with 1,400 nits of peak brightness that tilts 90 degrees upward and 43 degrees downward to make high and low angle shooting easier. Hasselblad also included a 5D joystick to change focus or operate the menus, addressing a big user complaint about the X2D 100C. It comes with 1TB of built-in storage as before \u2014 something almost no other mirrorless camera offers \u2014 along with a CFexpress Type B slot (as before, there's no support for video). Finally, Hasselblad introduced a new app, Phocus Mobile 2, that allows users to remotely control the camera, transfer shots and even edit them.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Hasselblad's X2D II 100C offers 10 stops of stabilization and much-improved autofocus\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/4c666210-818f-11f0-a3dd-909d308ea306\" style=\"height: 1572px; width: 2500px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Hasselblad\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>As for the price, it's less shocking than you may expect. The Hasselblad X2D II 100C is now on sale for $7,399, $800 less than the X2D 100C at launch and (perhaps strategically) $100 less than rival <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/fujifilm-gfx-100-ii-the-king-of-medium-format-mirrorless-cameras-143009929.html\">Fujifilm's GFX100 II</a> was at launch.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Hasselblad also introduced a new zoom lens, the XCD 2.8-4 35-100E (28-76mm full-frame equivalent). It promises \"top-tier\" optical performance and the fastest stepping motor in its XCD lens lineup, along with control rings for shutter speed, aperture and more. Like all Hasselblad lenses, it incorporates a leaf shutter that allows for up to 1/4000th flash sync speeds for easier use of fill light in bright conditions. The XCD 2.8-4 35-100E is now available for $4,599.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Finally, the company introduced the $469 Hasselblad-branded Vandra 20-liter backpack that will help you flaunt the brand name even if the camera's tucked away. It can hold an X2D II 100C body, two lenses and accessories. Finally, Hasselblad unveiled three new 86mm filters: a UV for $299, ND ($329) and circular polarizer (CPL) for $559.

The plan to convert Intel\u2019s previously promised CHIPS Act funding into equity in the company was first reported earlier in August. Intel was supposed to receive up to $10.86 billion in federal funding to expand its chip manufacturing business in the US as part of the CHIPS Act. By agreeing to this deal, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is likely trying to make sure funding still goes through, one of several drastic moves to keep Intel afloat. Tan assumed the title of CEO following Pat Gelsinger\u2019s sudden retirement in 2024.

Much of the time, the answer is simple: Get the best one you can afford. And if you\u2019re happy with your current iPhone, don\u2019t feel the need to make a change at all. But if you\u2019re ready to upgrade, allow us to help. We\u2019ve reviewed just about every iPhone ever released, so we\u2019ve picked through all nine models in Apple\u2019s current smartphone lineup and highlighted the ones that should satisfy most people below.<br /><br />Before we dive in, note that we\u2019ve based our guide on the list prices of new, unlocked iPhones on Apple.com. If you can find a steep discount from another trusted retailer or a good deal on a refurbished model, that could change the value equation.<br /><br />We\u2019ll also note that right now is arguably the worst time to buy a new model. Apple has released its latest iPhones each September like clockwork for several years, and we expect that trend to continue with the inevitable <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-max-and-air-release-dates-colors-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-about-apples-new-phones-153024847.html\">iPhone 17 series</a> (and the full <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-beta-how-to-download-the-update-on-your-iphone-new-features-like-liquid-glass-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-135749293.html\">iOS 26 update</a>) next month. So if you can hold out a little longer \u2014 even if it\u2019s just to save another $100 or so on last year\u2019s iPhone 16 devices, which will likely receive a price cut \u2014 you should.

The 15 Plus is particularly appealing as the most affordable big-screen iPhone in Apple\u2019s current lineup. It has excellent battery performance as well.</p> \n<p>At $699 or $799, though, both phones are priced in something of a no man\u2019s land. Most people who care about ultrawide cameras and MagSafe support should just spend another $100 for the iPhone 16 or 16 Plus, which add AI features, a slightly improved ultrawide lens with macro support, an extra hour or two of battery life, faster wireless charging (25W vs. 15W), a quicker processor, more RAM, the Action button and the Camera Control button.</p> \n<p>Those who aren't as particular about specs, meanwhile, are probably happy to save an extra $100 on the iPhone 16e, which is still better equipped for the long-term thanks to its faster chip and Apple Intelligence support. As a result, the 15 and 15 Plus will probably make the most sense if you can find a good price on a refurbished model.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-iphone-faqs\">iPhone FAQs</h2> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"The bottom half of both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max standing on a table.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-09/b9bf45e0-756d-11ef-b5db-383a7cce709c\" style=\"height: 1800px; width: 3200px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Brian Oh for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-when-is-the-best-time-of-year-to-buy-an-iphone\">When is the best time of year to buy an iPhone?</h3> \n<p>The best time to buy an iPhone, or really any product, is whenever you need one. But if you want to maximize how long your iPhone is considered \u201ccurrent,\u201d plan to upgrade in late September. Apple <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone#Models\">almost always</a> introduces its new core models around then. SE and \u201ce\u201d iPhones, meanwhile, have arrived between February and April, but those aren\u2019t guaranteed annual releases.</p> \n<p>Cash discounts on new unlocked iPhones are rare, so there usually isn\u2019t much reason to wait for a deal before buying (as is often the case with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-phones-are-on-sale-for-record-low-prices-170952808.html\">Samsung</a> or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/googles-pixel-9-pro-is-200-off-plus-the-rest-of-the-weeks-best-tech-deals-180041864.html\">Google</a> phones). Carriers will run their own sales, but those typically involve locking you into years-long service plans. The exception would be if you specifically want an older iPhone, since Apple typically cuts the price of its last-gen devices by $100 or more when it introduces a new model. So, for instance, if you know you won\u2019t care about the inevitable iPhone 17\u2019s upgrades, you could wait until that device is announced and get the iPhone 16 for a little cheaper.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-long-does-an-iphone-last\">How long does an iPhone last?</h3> \n<p>This depends on the person and how they define \u201clast.\u201d If we had to give a broad estimate, we\u2019d say most iPhone users keep their device between two and four years. If you\u2019re particularly sensitive to performance and camera improvements, you might want to upgrade on the earlier side of that timeline. If you\u2019re not as picky, you could hold out for even longer \u2014 though you\u2019ll likely want to get a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/battery-replacement\">battery replacement</a> sometime around the three- or four-year mark (or whenever you notice your battery life has severely degraded).</p> \n<p>Software support shouldn\u2019t be a problem regardless: Apple is renowned for keeping its devices up-to-date long-term, and the current version of iOS 18 is available on iPhones <a href=\"https://endoflife.date/iphone\">dating back to 2018</a>. (Though the forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-reveals-comprehensive-redesign-for-ios-26-at-wwdc-2025-171650751.html\">iOS 26 update</a> will push the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-is-releasing-ios-26-this-fall-will-your-iphone-be-compatible-191854628.html\">cutoff line</a> up a year.) Most of those older phones <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/121115\">don\u2019t support</a> Apple Intelligence, so there isn\u2019t <em>total</em> parity, but that\u2019s not a big loss in the grand scheme of things.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-i-know-how-old-my-iphone-is\">How do I know how old my iPhone is?</h3> \n<p>Go to your iPhone\u2019s Settings, then tap General &gt; About. You should see the Model Name right near the top. You can also tap the Model Number below that, then verify the resulting four-digit code on <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/108044\">Apple\u2019s identification page</a> to further confirm.</p> \n<p>If you don\u2019t want to use software, for whatever reason, you can also find your iPhone\u2019s model number <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/106343\">printed within</a> its USB-C or Lightning port, if the device lacks a SIM tray. For older devices, you can alternatively find that number within the SIM slot or \u2014 if you\u2019re still hanging onto an iPhone 7 or older \u2014 right on the back of the handset.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</h2> \n<p><strong>August 2025</strong>: We\u2019ve taken another pass to ensure our advice is still up-to-date and noted that we expect to Apple to launch new phones soon in September.</p> \n<p><strong>June 2025</strong>: We\u2019ve lightly edited this guide for clarity and added a few common FAQs.

Many members of the Imgur community have <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1mzsw9n/whats_up_with_imgur_raging_about_medialab/\"><ins>claimed</ins></a> that MediaLab fired most of its US content moderation team in favor of AI, while others have said that the site is <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/even-asking-whats-happening-is-enough-to-get-comments-deleted-as-such-you-business-daddy-XYiPkt2\"><ins>deleting</ins></a> or <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/is-imgur-really-killing-itself-q8yAazH\"><ins>hiding</ins></a> content that is critical of the owner and its policies.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The exact timeline, as well as what brought things to a tipping point, is still fuzzy at best. But for hours today, the Imgur homepage has been dominated by spammed images of a John Oliver meme in protest of what users see as MediaLab's poor management of the platform. Whatever team is currently working at Imgur appears to be unable to handle the rate that the memes are being posted, so it's anyone's guess how long the spam protest will dominate the front page.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/imgur-protest-covers-the-front-page-in-anti-medialab-memes-225502091.html?src=rss"}

Blizzard </span><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24224138/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">announced</span></a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> that Season 18 will introduce a new take on the progression system. As they currently stand, the progression numbers feel pretty divorced from the gameplay; this revamp introduces new ways to display your prowess to teammates and foes in matches as well as some welcome changes to how you see and equip your rewards.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The new Progression 2.0 system has overhauled the visual side. For starters, there will be new portrait frames that increase in fanciness every 20 levels, capping at level 60. These Ascended borders will be displayed when you pick your hero for a match. Between the different Ascended frames, players will unlock five tiers of hero badges that also display in Hero Select under your portrait.&nbsp;</span></p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot from Overwatch 2 showing the five new hero badges that can be unlocked.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/herobadges.jpeg\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>Overwatch 2 Hero Badges</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Blizzard</div></figure><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">In addition to the new flash, the Hero Select screen will show your allies a card with your top heroes on it. I doubt anyone will pay too much attention to cards in the Open Queue matches, so this seems like a Competitive-angled addition. It could help make it easy to build a team composition based on the whole group's strengths, creating a test of your crew's cooperation ability before the game even starts. Blizzard clarified that in Competitive, opponents won't be able to see your portrait borders until 10-15 seconds after a match begins, and hero cards won't be displayed to an enemy until one of you eliminates each other. That means nobody should be able to use your hero card against you in the </span><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/blizzard-explains-hero-bans-ahead-of-their-introduction-in-competitive-overwatch-210319297.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">ban phase</span></a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">I've almost never thought about the rewards I get for progression stats because it's unclear when I've gotten a new item and I rarely bother searching for them in my cosmetics collections, so having a dedicated progression menu added should place a new focus on tracking how far you've gotten with a particular character. The hero-specific rewards on the horizon will be displayed on that page, and already-unlocked items can be equipped directly from that menu. Blizzard is also offering occasional Epic and Legendary loot box freebies as you rise through the ranks for each hero, which is always welcome.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The progression levels will be rewarded retroactively when the season starts. For long-time fans, that means you can expect to see a whole bunch of rewards to browse through when you first log in during Season 18. For new players, there will be more credits and cosmetics available to unlock in the first 20 levels. That first set of 20 levels will also be scaled to be quicker to complete, while later levels will require more time.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The new season kicks off tomorrow, on August 26.

If you can't wait any longer, you can <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-install-the-ios-26-public-beta-171117199.html\">download and install</a> the newly released public beta 4 (or <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes\">iOS 26 developer beta 8</a> for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html\">taking screenshots</a> is way better in the new operating system \u2014 Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html\">preview of the iOS 26 public beta release</a>, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html\">Liquid Glass</a>, the translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-26-beta-preview-spotlights-time-to-shine-171700779.html\">macOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html\">iPadOS</a> and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/wwdc-2025-everything-apple-announced-including-ios-26-liquid-glass-design-and-more-171718030.html\">WWDC keynote</a> on June 9.</p>\n<p>After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Siri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant \u2014 first promised at WWDC 2024 \u2014 is delayed until some point \"<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html\">in the coming year</a>,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-chatgpt-claude-siri/\">basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models</a> like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-reportedly-has-a-stripped-down-ai-chatbot-to-compete-with-chatgpt-in-the-works-164345473.html\">'stripped-down' AI chatbot</a> to rival ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>With each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html\">new AirPods gesture</a> we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">freeze your video if it detects nudity</a>. With the release of the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes\">iOS 26 developer beta 5</a>, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/ios-26-beta-5-features/\"><em>MacRumors </em>reports</a>. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-is-releasing-ios-26-this-fall-heres-the-full-list-of-compatible-iphones-191854795.html\">eligible to download iOS 26 </a>(both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-is-ios-26\">What is iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>The current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it \u2014 version 18.6.1 was released to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apples-redesigned-blood-oxygen-monitoring-feature-hits-apple-watches-in-the-us-today-131558485.html\">restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring</a> functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-just-dropped-a-security-update-for-all-its-platforms-194528494.html\">Apple released 18.6.2</a> to address a vulnerability related to image processing. Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/22/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-6/\"><em>MacRumors reports</em></a>, which means it can no longer be installed on your iPhone due to a \"server-side software verification check.\" That's pretty normal when newer versions are available to download.</p>\n<p>But don't expect to see iOS 19 soon \u2014 or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"a list of the new OSes\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/29bbb6f0-4555-11f0-b2de-ada42a83075d\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>It's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-is-liquid-glass-design\">What is Liquid Glass design?</h2>\n<p>Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html\">new Liquid Glass design</a> was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year \u2014 the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.</p>\n<p>So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"<a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=86b7b54f-7ccd-4fbb-a927-09c327b93cbc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=new+translucent+material&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8wNi9hcHBsZS1lbGV2YXRlcy10aGUtaXBob25lLWV4cGVyaWVuY2Utd2l0aC1pb3MtMjYvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NmI3YjU0Zi03Y2NkLTRmYmItYTkyNy0wOWMzMjdiOTNjYmMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzcm9vbS8yMDI1LzA2L2FwcGxlLWVsZXZhdGVzLXRoZS1pcGhvbmUtZXhwZXJpZW5jZS13aXRoLWlvcy0yNi8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVivyXXsD7DiKwA3X-v-YLSp-mKPz8KpUrb1ctVS4Hji&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F06%2Fapple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26%2F\">new translucent material</a>\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some \u2014 including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar \u2014 like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-liquid-glass-is-windows-vista-done-well-181954910.html\">Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs</a> from nearly twenty years ago.</p>\n<p>That said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html\">has already incorporated some user feedback</a> into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-26-will-bring-apples-new-liquid-glass-ui-to-your-desktop-174149070.html\">the new macOS Tahoe 26</a> on your desktop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-are-the-new-and-notable-features-of-ios-26\">What are the new and notable features of iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:</p>\n<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages:</strong> iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Polls in group chats:</strong> Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.</p>\n<p><strong>Filtering unknown senders in Messages:</strong> If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual Intelligence:</strong> Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html\">screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence</a> to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.</p>\n<p><strong>Photos tabs are back:</strong> For anyone who's still frustrated with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-apple-redesigned-its-photos-app-around-customization-120038901.html\">Photos changes made last year</a>, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: </strong>A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature</a> that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-customize-your-iphones-lock-screen-on-ios-26-110535863.html\"><strong>New lock screen options</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"New Hold Assist being displayed at the wwdc keynote\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/a506ddc0-4556-11f0-9d7a-9a93e6a181c1\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes.

Here's what's coming this fall.</p>\n<p><strong>Multitasking and real windowing:</strong> When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual update:</strong> Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.</p>\n<p><strong>New menu bar:</strong> When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.</p>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html\">first impressions of iPadOS 26</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-about-airpods\">What about AirPods?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ios-26-updates-for-airpods-preview-enhanced-audio-recording-camera-remote-and-more-173036046.html\">AirPods are also getting updated</a> with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced audio recording:</strong> Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Camera remote control:</strong> Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.</p>\n<p><strong>Live translation feature:</strong> While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html\">could be coming with iOS 26</a>. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time.

As with most unreleased iPhones, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Apple in September.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-are-the-latest-iphone-17-rumors\">What are the latest iPhone 17 rumors?</h2>\n<p>Not necessarily a \"new\" rumor but Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes there actually will be a new orange color offered for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, as well as a light blue color for the iPhone 17 Air, he <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-24/apple-to-launch-iphone-17-pro-iphone-17-air-in-september-iphone-fold-next-year-mepmzpcj\">confirmed in his weekly Power On newsletter</a>.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Additionally, we have a new case rumor.<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/25/apple-liquid-silicone-iphone-17-case-colors/\"> According to leaker Majin Bu</a>, there will be new Liquid Silicone cases in eight colors, including Deep Orange, Pale Orange, Grass Green, Celadon, Fog Purple, Grey Blue, Dark Blue and Midnight Black.&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"74cbca8d2df64cbca62aec5d73509fc7\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">iPhone 17: New Liquid Silicone Cases Colors<br /><br />Full Article:<a href=\"https://t.co/RBnAO3LCAC\">https://t.co/RBnAO3LCAC</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/GuQuvrswg6\">pic.twitter.com/GuQuvrswg6</a></p>\u2014 Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1959594436691886573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 24, 2025</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>These rumors haven't been confirmed by Apple and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models will look like until the iPhone event next month.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-much-will-the-iphone-17-cost\">How much will the iPhone 17 cost?</h2>\n<p>Apple's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-to-invest-another-100-billion-into-the-us-to-avoid-tariffs-210250020.html\">announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners</a> seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/gaming/deals/article/ps5-console-prices-have-gone-up-heres-where-you-can-still-get-them-for-50-less-211140296.html\">PlayStations</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-original-nintendo-switch-is-about-to-get-more-expensive-in-the-us-170646701.html\">Switch consoles</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/nikon-joins-other-camera-manufacturers-in-raising-prices-due-to-tariffs-120011854.html\">high-end cameras</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/sonos-is-raising-prices-this-year-to-make-up-for-tariff-expenses-123031336.html\">Sonos speakers</a>. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/will-iphone-17-pro-start-at-256gb-storage/\">posted by <em>MacRumors</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>from a leaker known as \"<a href=\"https://weibo.com/u/5143897135\">Instant Digital</a>,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/30/iphone-17-price-increase-expected/\">price increase of $50</a>, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/every-macbook-air-now-starts-with-16gb-of-ram-at-no-extra-cost-150041320.html\">doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers</a> from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 \u2014 but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-when-will-the-iphone-17s-be-announced\">When will the iPhone 17 series be announced?</h2>\n<p>Most years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/apple-iphone-17-event-set-september-9/\"><em>MacRumors </em>highlighted</a> a story originally reported by <a href=\"https://www.iphone-ticker.de/iphone-17-vorstellung-wohl-am-9-verkaufsstart-am-19-september-261445/\">iphone-ticker.de</a> that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.</p>\n<p>It's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-reportedly-wants-to-split-up-the-iphones-release-schedule-164737099.html\">split</a> into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-new-iphone-17-lineup-include\">What will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?</h2>\n<p>Design leaks suggest that Apple is building an <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-said-to-be-working-on-a-significantly-thinner-iphone-180823565.html\">ultra-thin smartphone</a>, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/this-year-could-bring-the-iphone-air-and-an-entry-level-ipad-with-apple-intelligence-175059162.html\">reported</a> in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16e-review-whats-your-acceptable-compromise-020016288.html\">iPhone 16e</a>. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.</p>\n<p>An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/iphone-17-air-titanium-rumor/\">indicated</a> that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.</p>\n<p>Additionally, an August 4 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/04/iphone-17-air-battery-half-thickness-17-pro/\"><em>MacRumors </em>report</a> says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick \u2014 half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the <a href=\"https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=223958615195&amp;navType=by\">Korean-language Naver blog</a>, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, <em>MacRumors</em> notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)</p>\n<p>On a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/iphone-17-pro-leak-aluminum-chassis/\">according to <em>MacRumors</em></a>. Originally <a href=\"https://majinbuofficial.com/iphone-17-pro-antennas-repositioned-around-the-camera-module/\">posted by leaker Majin Bu</a>, the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. <em>MacRumors</em> says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight.</p>\n<p>That same leaker (Majin Bu), whom <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/iphone-17-pro-antenna-rumor/\"><em>MacRumors </em></a>classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual <a href=\"https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1954890746693312762\">posted a render on X</a> that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://majinbuofficial.com/iphone-17-new-tech-woven-case-unveiled/\">Leaker Majin Bu also claims</a> \"TechWoven\" cases could be introduced, per a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/20/techwoven-cases-crossbody-strap-rumor/\"><em>MacRumors</em> report</a>. The cases match the rumored design on the iPhone 17 models, with the wide camera bump. The leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for \"convenient and secure carrying,\" so it could be worn around your neck. The colors would come in grey/black, blue, green, purple and orange.</p>\n<p>Each new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the <a href=\"https://x.com/Skyfops/status/1949936265232888057\">purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\"</a> The pics, highlighted on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/28/iphone-17-pro-possibly-spotted-in-the-wild/\"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.</p>\n<div id=\"a462ba8164d54c5a8ac8626b1540fe2f\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29 <a href=\"https://t.co/iS3PtKWqxJ\">pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ</a></p>\u2014 Fox Pupy \ud83e\udd8a\ud83e\udde1 (@Skyfops) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Skyfops/status/1949936265232888057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 28, 2025</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>The iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus.

He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 \u2014 likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.</p>\n<p>We've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2849423/iphone-17-colors-confirmed-see-all-of-apples-2026-options-right-here.html\"><em>Macworld</em></a> reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.</p>\n<p>On July 30, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/iphone-17-dummies-just-leaked-in-all-colors-and-theres-a-bold-new-signature-hue\"><em>Tom's Guide</em></a> highlighted an X post from <a href=\"https://x.com/SonnyDickson/status/1950325609957380405\">Sonny Dickson</a> \u2014 a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information \u2014 showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned <em>Macworld</em> story. While these are literally just mock-ups \u2014 not real, leaked iPhones \u2014 it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.</p>\n<p>To add the the rumors, a Weibo leaker known as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/\">Digital Chat Station</a> suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/18/iphone-17e-rumored-to-gain-new-design-and-more/\"><em>MacRumors</em> reports</a>. According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. However, it's important to note this report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16e-review-whats-your-acceptable-compromise-020016288.html\">iPhone 16e</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-new-ios-be-like\">What will iOS 26 be like?</h2>\n<p>Apple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-public-beta-is-live-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-iphone-features-and-how-to-use-them-135749325.html\">iOS 26</a>.</p>\n<p>On the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html\">scaling down</a> the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.</p>\n<p>The feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">freeze FaceTime video</a> if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.</p>\n<p>iOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls.

That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html\">watchOS 26</a>, of course.) Other possibilities \u2014 and this is, again, speculation \u2014 could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218-130048292.html\">last big update in 2022</a>) and maybe new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apples-next-airtag-is-coming-in-2025-with-privacy-improvements-173028439.html\">AirTags trackers</a> (first released in 2021).</p>\n<p>The Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/every-apple-secret-that-leaked-yesterday/\"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/new-apple-tv-coming-later-this-year-with-a17-pro-chip/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/homepod-mini-new-chip/\">HomePod mini</a>, new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 \u2014 if ever.

Why would they settle for less?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">It's not clear if this plan replaces Perplexity's existing Publisher Program, or will exist alongside it.

The biggest change is that all of the new Nest devices built-in cameras will reportedly record in 2K resolution, rather than 1080p. They'll also come in a selection of new colors. The Nest Cam Indoor comes in &quot;Snow&quot; (white), &quot;Berry&quot; (red) and &quot;Hazel&quot; (gray). The camera will include a new &quot;Zoom and Crop&quot; feature that lets you crop a camera feed to focus on a specific area, and be able to store up to an hour of footage locally if your Wi-Fi goes out. Google also plans to expand how long it'll store video previews of events Nest Cams detect, taking the library of 10-second previews from one hour to three.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(32, 43, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The Nest Cam Outdoor will only come in Snow and Hazel, but it'll reportedly include all the new features of the Nest Cam Indoor. The same goes for the new Nest Doorbell, except it'll be available in Snow, Hazel and &quot;Linen&quot; (beige). The decision to largely use the same design on its Nest devices and focus on changing internal components and software features is a similar strategy to what Google used with the </span><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-series-hands-on-the-base-model-takes-center-stage-160040470.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Pixel 10 lineup</span></a><span style=\"color: rgb(32, 43, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">. The phones largely look the same, but they feature improved internals and plenty of new software features.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(32, 43, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><em>Android Headlines</em> writes that Google plans to use this hardware launch to also rebrand its Nest Aware and Aware Plus subscriptions. The new name for Google's entry-level smart home subscription will be Google Home Premium. The company also plans to sell a Google Home Premium Advanced. As far as which subscription offers what, and if certain Gemini features will be locked behind a higher price, we'll have to wait until Google details its smart home plans. The company said Gemini for Home will launch in October, so expect more official announcements in the coming months.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/googles-new-smart-home-hardware-looks-mostly-familiar-in-leaked-images-190011191.html?src=rss"}

This is another new low, and it applies to various color options and storage configs.</p> \n<p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DK3W6TV6&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=5c2b9c33-9a87-45ff-b978-e41b8f7a90a2&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Apple+iPad+mini+%28A17+Pro%29+for+%24399+%28%24100+off%29&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLWlQYWQtTWluaS1BMTctUHJvL2RwL0IwREszVzZUVjYvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjVjMmI5YzMzLTlhODctNDVmZi1iOTc4LWU0MWI4ZjdhOTBhMiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1pUGFkLU1pbmktQTE3LVByby9kcC9CMERLM1c2VFY2LyIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXybJq3Z7EzDSF65W3vdVIIgX8pEsTNAtFGt13v0bYAY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPad-Mini-A17-Pro%2Fdp%2FB0DK3W6TV6%2F\"><strong>Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off)</strong></a>: The iPad mini is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-mini-7-review-safe-boring-and-everything-i-want-in-a-small-tablet-130039378.html\">exactly what it sounds like</a>: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip \u2014 which is enough to support Apple Intelligence \u2014 along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As before, you\u2019d buy it if you value the smaller 8.3-inch display and want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. This deal is $20 more than the lowest price we've tracked.

Its 220-mile range and 215-horsepower output were middling at best when compared to vehicles like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-starts-selling-cheaper-model-y-evs-in-the-us-124506011.html\">Tesla Model Y</a>. Its quirky styling didn't exactly help, either.</p>\n<p>For 2026, Subaru is giving the Solterra a significant up-do. Don't call it a reboot, as it's still very much the same SUV as before, but with more range, more power and better tech (though we're still waiting on the pricing). The result is a much more compelling car. Now, with Tesla's international appeal falling to an all-time low, which takes the Model Y off the table for many buyers, Subaru's first EV feels like it's finally found its time to shine.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2 id=\"jump-link-more-of-what-you-want\">More of what you want</h2>\n<figure><img alt=\"2026 Subaru Solterra\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/a2f671d0-7c60-11f0-94bb-0c1e2f9d7e43\" style=\"height: 1707px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>I'm the first person to tell a potential EV buyer that range is not the first criterion they should be considering when EV shopping. There are many more important factors that impact your quality of life on a daily basis than how many charging stops you'll need to make on your annual road trip. Still, when the original Solterra was doing 220 miles on a charge, while the Tesla Model Y did well over 300, that made the thing a bit of a hard sell.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, the 2026 Solterra gets a big bump in that department, up to 288 miles on a charge. It\u2019s not class-leading by any means, but as someone who's lived with EVs for years, I can confidently say that's plenty of juice to eliminate range anxiety for most.</p>\n<p>Impressively, the new Subaru does that on a battery pack that's barely any bigger: 74.7 kWh vs. 72.8 before. Where does the extra range come from, then? Subaru and Toyota engineers (this car is mechanically identical to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/toyota-hopes-for-a-smoother-start-with-its-redesigned-bz-all-electric-suv-182426253.html\">2026 Toyota bZ</a>) deployed a raft of subtle improvements that result in substantial efficiency, everything from aerodynamic tweaks to updated electronics and new motors.</p>\n<p>When it's time to plug in, the Solterra and the Model Y can now use the same chargers. For 2026, the Solterra switches over to a Tesla-style NACS port, though the car comes with adapters for using J1772 and CCS ports. Outright charging speed is up by 50 percent over last year's car, but that only equates to a maximum charging rate of 150 kW. Again, it\u2019s a big improvement, but not class-leading.</p>\n<p>It can at least burn those electrons more quickly. Outright power is up, with the Solterra now putting down 338 horsepower through all four wheels on the XT trims, a nice boost from the old car's 215.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-big-display-big-safety\">Big display, big safety</h2>\n<figure><img alt=\"2026 Subaru Solterra\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/23a64810-7c60-11f0-9fee-243690f0aea5\" style=\"height: 1707px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>All those updates are nice, but potential buyers will be more immediately wooed by a completely rethought dashboard layout that's still quirky but significantly less awkward than before. A new, 14-inch touchscreen dominates proceedings, giving you quick and easy access to everything from navigation to media playback. It serves as a generous canvas for either Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, both of which are offered wirelessly.</p>\n<p>There's not one but two wireless charging pads to keep your devices juiced while slinging tunes and navigation, plus a pair of USB-C ports in the second row for passengers. With 60 watts of output, back-seat productivity hounds can keep <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-windows-laptop-130018256.html\">happily typing away</a> even if they forgot their adapter.</p>\n<p>They'll be comfortable, too. There's a good amount of headroom and legroom in the rear seat, plus 23.8 cubic feet of cargo space in the rear.</p>\n<p>When it comes to keeping everyone safe, the new Solterra offers Subaru's EyeSight system standard, including automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and a lane-centering system. I got a good chance to sample these systems in the increasingly heavy traffic in and around Denver, Colorado. The adaptive cruise brought the car to a complete stop and resumed on its own when traffic came to a crawl, while the active lane-keep system ensured the Solterra stayed centered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-drive\">The drive</h2>\n<figure><img alt=\"2026 Subaru Solterra\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/666c8ce0-7c60-11f0-af50-d48df41f78af\" style=\"height: 1707px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>For my day behind the wheel of the new Solterra, Subaru provided me with a model in top-shelf Touring XT trim, the highest performance. That meant I got to sample the car's full 338 horsepower, but I have to admit that in terms of acceleration, the thing still isn't a rocket ship. It has the instant torque of an EV and is certainly quick, but the power is delivered in a somewhat more relaxed way than many of the peppier EVs on the market today.</p>\n<p>That character continues throughout the Solterra drive experience. Steering is quite sharp and responsive, but the suspension doesn't really encourage any overly dramatic cornering antics. The traction and stability control systems quickly and abruptly kill all power at the first hint of loss of grip. For many Subaru enthusiasts, that's just when things start getting fun.</p>\n<p>It won't be a terror on your favorite gravel road, but the Solterra is reasonably competent when the asphalt ends. Subaru set up a short dirt course, which was more meander through the trees than proper expedition. Still, it proved the SUV capable on the sorts of terrain a mass-market machine like this is liable to see.</p>\n<p>In terms of comfort and ride quality, the Solterra handled most road imperfections and bumps without issue, but felt a little harsh over bigger stuff. There's no real wind noise or the like, making it a quiet and calm highway cruiser, but a fair bit of road noise did come up through the suspension on rougher stretches of asphalt.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wrap-up\">Wrap-up</h2>\n<figure><img alt=\"2026 Subaru Solterra\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/8532d0d0-7c60-11f0-b5f5-aa9ed72fa30d\" style=\"height: 1707px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Tim Stevens for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>In many ways, this improved Solterra feels like the electric SUV that the brand should have launched in the first place. Better late than never. The big boost in range and performance, plus all the other tech and feature upgrades, make for a significantly improved car. It still comes up a little short of the competition from Hyundai or Tesla in terms of key metrics that EV shoppers tend to hyper-fixate on \u2014 particularly range \u2014 but it's close enough now to be judged on its other merits. Thankfully, those merits are good.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 25, 2025, 11:14AM ET:</strong> This story was originally published with a placeholder for the Solterra's price, which hasn't yet been announced.
