With so much uncertainty surrounding both personal and business aspects of affiliate marketing. In this post, we will answer the most frequently asked question about affiliate marketing</span><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">1. What is affiliate marketing?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2. What is an affiliate program?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money?&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.&nbsp; Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">4. What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;5. Can affiliate marketing and performance marketing be considered the same thing?</span></h4><p><!--Ads Managed by AdSpyglass.com-->\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Performance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising.

Is it possible to promote affiliate offers on mobile devices?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7. Where do I find qualified publishers?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;The best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius.

Does social media activity play a significant role in affiliate marketing?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10. What is a super affiliate?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;A super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program.&nbsp; Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">11. How do we track publisher sales activity?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Publishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network's dashboard.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;12. Could we set up an affiliate program in multiple countries?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Because the Internet is so widespread, affiliate programs can be promoted in any country.

What is a commission rate?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Commission rates are typically based on a percentage of the total sale and in some cases can also be a flat fee for each transaction. The rates are set by the merchant.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Who manages your affiliate program?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Some merchants run their affiliate programs internally, while others choose to contract out management to a network or an external agency.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">18. What is a cookie?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Cookies are small pieces of data that work with web browsers to store information such as user preferences, login or registration data, and shopping cart contents. When someone clicks on your affiliate link, a cookie is placed on the user's computer or mobile device. That cookie is used to remember the link or ad that the visitor clicked on. Even if the user leaves your site and comes back a week later to make a purchase, you will still get credit for the sale and receive a commission it depends on the site cookies duration</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">19. How long do cookies last?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;The merchant determines the duration of a cookie, also known as its \u201ccookie life.\u201d The most common length for an affiliate program is 30 days. If someone clicks on your affiliate link, you\u2019ll be paid a commission if they purchase within 30 days of the click.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Final Saying</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Most new affiliates are eager to begin their affiliate marketing business.

Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>To understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:</b></span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain collects information in \u201cblocks\u201d.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A block has a storage capacity, and once it's used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blocks form chains, which are called \u201cBlockchains.\u201d</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">More information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Each block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can't be changed.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><b>Let\u2019s get to know more about the blockchain.</b></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">How does blockchain work?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called \"Distributed Ledger Technology\" or DLT.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Here\u2019s how it works:</span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Someone or a computer will transacts</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The transaction is transmitted throughout the network.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A network of computers can confirm the transaction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">When it is confirmed a transaction is added to a block</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The blocks are linked together to create a history.</span></li></ul><p></p>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7\"></div><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">And that\u2019s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it\u2019s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.</span></p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Once a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction.</span></li></ul><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">How are Blockchains used?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Even though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Although some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Tracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been\u2014so they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is Blockchain Decentralization?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology is safe, even if it\u2019s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Have you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Instead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called \u201cDecentralization,\u201d meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain guarantees your data's authenticity\u2014not just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's product inventory.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pros and Cons of Blockchain</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain has many advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Pros</span></h2><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Accuracy is increased because there is no human involvement in the verification process.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">One of the great things about decentralization is that it makes information harder to tamper with.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Safe, private, and easy transactions</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Provides a banking alternative and safe storage of personal information</span></li></ul><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Cons</span></h2><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Data storage has limits.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The regulations are always changing, as they differ from place to place.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">It has a risk of being used for illicit activities&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Frequently Asked Questions About Blockchain</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">I\u2019ll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is Blockchain a cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It's a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Is it possible for Blockchain to be hacked?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Yes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the most prominent blockchain company?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Coinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Who owns Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain is a decentralized technology. It\u2019s a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain technology?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency&nbsp;</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">What is the difference between Blockchain and a Database?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Generally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.</span></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Final Saying</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Blockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won't be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">1) What is an NFT?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">NFT stands for non-fungible&nbsp; token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2) What is Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information\u2014such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts\u2014in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can\u2019t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3) What makes an NFT valuable?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br />\n</span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn\u2019t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">4) How do NFTs work?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">One of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">As with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can\u2019t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">NFTs also contain smart contracts\u2014small computer programs that run on the blockchain\u2014that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">5) What\u2019s the connection between NFTs and cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Anyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you\u2019ll be able to upload and sell your creations</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">6) How to validate the authencity of an NFT?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">When you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain\u2014the bitcoin ledger of transactions\u2014and that entry acts as your proof of ownership.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7) How is an NFT valued? What are the most expensive NFTs?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">In the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">8) Can NFTs be used as an investment?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">9) Will NFTs be the future of art and collectibles?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Many people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work.

On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">11) Can i mint NFT for free?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">To mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Do i own an NFT if i screenshot it?</span></h3>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-adee9769ea74eb59e82d4f0cb2e6f816\"></div><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Why are people investing so much in NFT?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /><span>&nbsp;Non-fungible tokens have gained the hearts of people around the world, and they have given digital creators the recognition they deserve. One of the remarkable things about non-fungible tokens is that you can take a screenshot of one, but you don\u2019t own it. This is because when a non-fungible token is created, then the transaction is stored on the blockchain, and the license or contract to hold such a token is awarded to the person owning the token in their digital wallet.</span><br /></span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">You can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred. This lets you get exposure without losing full ownership of your work. Some of the most successful projects include Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yatch Club NFTs, SandBox, World of Women and so on. These NFT projects have gained popularity globally and are owned by celebrities and other successful entrepreneurs. Owning one of these NFTs gives you an automatic ticket to exclusive business meetings and life-changing connections.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Final Saying</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">That\u2019s a wrap. Hope you guys found this article enlightening. I just answer some question with my limited knowledge about NFTs.

Why is email marketing important?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email is the marketing tool that helps you&nbsp; create a seamless, connected, frictionless buyer journey. More importantly, email marketing allows you to build relationships with prospects, customers, and past customers. It's your chance to speak&nbsp; to them right in their inbox, at a time that suits them. Along with the right message, email can become one of your most powerful marketing channels.</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2.

What is the simplest day and time to send my marketing emails?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Again, the answer to this question varies from company to company. And again, testing is the way to find out what works best. Typically, weekends and mornings seem to be&nbsp; times when multiple emails are opened, but since your audience may have different habits, it's best to experiment and then use your&nbsp; data to decide.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;4. Which metrics should I be looking at?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The two most important metrics for email marketing are&nbsp; open rate and click-through rate. If your emails aren't opened, subscribers will never see your full marketing message, and if they open them but don't click through to your site, your emails won't convert.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">5. How do I write a decent subject line?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The best subject lines are short and to the point, accurately describing&nbsp; the content of the email, but also catchy and intriguing, so the reader wants to know more. Once Again, this is the perfect place for&nbsp; A/B testing, to see what types of subject lines work best with your audience. Your call to action should be clear and&nbsp; simple. It should be somewhere at the top of your email for those who haven't finished reading the entire email,&nbsp; then repeated&nbsp; at the end for those reading all the way through. It should state exactly what you want subscribers to do, for example \"Click here to download the premium theme for free.</span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /><br />\n\n<br />6. Is email marketing still effective?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Email marketing is one of the most effective ways for a business to reach its customers directly. Think about it. You don't post something on your site&nbsp; hoping people will visit it. You don't even post something on a social media page and hope fans&nbsp; see it. You're sending something straight to each person's inbox, where they'll definitely&nbsp; see it! Even if they don't open it, they'll still see your subject line and business name every time you send an email, so you're still communicating directly with your audience.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span><br /></span><br />\n\n<br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7. However do I grow my email subscribers list? Should i buy an email list or build it myself?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Buying an email list is&nbsp; waste of time &amp; money.

There are different ways to grow your mailing list.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><span>Give them a free ebook and host it on a landing page where they have to enter the email to download the file and also create a forum page on your website, asks your visitors what questions they might have about your business, and collects email addresses to follow up with them.</span><br />\n\n<br /></span></div>\n\n  <div id=\"atContainer-05a47ba863f62ec113e14b51b976d14a\"></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">8. How do I prevent audience from unsubscribing?</span></h3><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">If the&nbsp; subject line of the email is irrelevant to&nbsp; customers, they will ignore it multiple times. But, if it keeps repeating, they are intercepted and unsubscribed from your emails. So, send relevant emails for the benefit of the customer. Don't send emails that often only focus&nbsp; on sales, offers and discounts.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Submit information about your business and offers so you can connect with customers.

The most important thing to prevent this from happening is to respect your recipients' choice to opt-out of receiving emails from you. You can add the links to easily unsubscribe.

I mean, they seemed friendly,\u201d she said.</p><p><strong>Maxwell also</strong> <strong>did not recall former US president Bill Clinton receiving a massage while travelling with Epstein</strong>.</p><p><strong>Blanche said, on the record, that the conversation was not \u201cpromising to do anything\u201d for Maxwell.</strong> He said that anything she said could not be used against her, unless she provided false statements or there was a retrial in her case.</p><p><strong>According to Maxwell, Epstein did not have any video or photographic evidence of any high-profile individuals committing sexual offences</strong>. And to that point, Maxwell also said she didn\u2019t hear or witness any instances of Epstein blackmailing powerful people.</p><p><strong>Maxwell said she recruited a number of masseuses for Epstein but \u201cnever checked their age or credentials</strong><strong>\u201d.</strong> She added that, throughout her time with Epstein, she never heard any examples of \u201csexually inappropriate contact\u201d between Epstein\u2019s guests and in-house masseuses.</p><p><strong>Despite her claims that Epstein did not extort anyone, Maxwell said she did not believe that Epstein died by suicide.</strong> She chalked that up to \u201cmismanagement\u201d at the Bureau of Prisons.</p><p><strong>In the interview, Maxwell said she does believe that Epstein \u201cdid a lot of, not all, but some of what he\u2019s accused of</strong><strong>\u201d.</strong> But she maintains that \u201che became that man over a period of time\u201d.</p><p><strong>Maxwell did not remember whether Trump submitted a letter for Epstein\u2019s 50th birthday album</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796?st=bhCa46\">as reported</a> by the Wall Street Journal.

It <a href=\"https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3984557?ln=en&amp;v=pdf\">prompted</a> the United Nations special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, Balakrishnan Rajagopal, to call it \"domicide\" - the deliberate, widespread and systematic destruction of home.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We have all seen the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2024/jan/30/how-war-destroyed-gazas-neighbourhoods-visual-investigation\">satellite imagery </a>that shows more than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unosat.org/products/4047\">70 percent of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure levelled</a>. By August 2025, the number of homes destroyed in Gaza totalled more than 282,000, corresponding to around <a href=\"https://unosat.org/products/4165\">78 percent</a> of the total structures in the Strip. <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel\">Israel\u2019s</a> calculated attacks on home have displaced almost everyone, generally multiple times.</p>\n\n<p>While these statistics are so familiar by now that our response may be muted, it is crucial to collect and reflect on this data.&nbsp;That data also cannot be overlooked because it points to where and how international law is deficient - even complicit - and, more optimistically, where it could do better.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    \n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Home is <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/5042232/GHOSTLY_MATTERS_Haunting_and_the_Sociological_Imagination_With_a_New_Introduction\">tangled</a> with systems of violence. It will be well known to many of you involved in the tribunal that home is an organising metaphor of settler-colonialism.&nbsp;According to Ariel Handel and Hagar Kotef,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.elgaronline.com/edcollchap/book/9781800882775/book-part-9781800882775-22.xml\">settler</a>-<a href=\"https://www.elgaronline.com/edcollchap/book/9781800882775/book-part-9781800882775-22.xml\">colonialism</a> is \"the story of homes that are themselves tools of destruction - homes that have been constructed on the ruins of others\u2019 homes\". Settler-colonialism is a project of homemaking and home-unmaking, with the settlements that spawn and now threaten to swallow Gaza.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The unmaking of home is not just about physical homes; it is also about the very sense of home and spatial attachments. The severing of connection to a place that is called home is profoundly devastating and resonates in manifold ways.</p>\n\n<p>We heard testimonies in which Gazans stressed the psychological and immaterial losses associated with the destruction of their home. One said that \"losing a home means losing your mental stability\". Another said they had \"no horizon for hope as they have lost their home\".</p>\n\n<p>The centrality of home to the logics of occupation, apartheid and genocide, and home\u2019s complex role both as a site of violence and control as well as agency and resistance, is important to understanding the mass destruction of home in Gaza. In the early months - when there were still homes standing - the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/02/israeli-grid-system-makes-life-in-gaza-macabre-game-of-battleships-say-aid-workers\">Israeli army used maps</a> carving up Gaza into numbered neighbourhoods to indicate which homes would be targeted and which homes Gazans should leave. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Weaponising home</h3>\n\n<p>Weaponising home, the maps transformed Gaza into the <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262720182/the-architectural-uncanny/\">unhomely</a> - an unfamiliar place of not-belonging, fear and alienation, far from the ideal of a safe and cosy home. &nbsp;As air strikes menaced street by street, home by home, we were reminded that home is contested ground. That far from being a neutral space, home is where struggles over the very nature of identity unfold.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    \n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Denied full agency or control over home, the conditions for home and for being at home in the world are radically altered. The pain of domicide extends not only to those whose homes have been destroyed, but also to those who cannot return home, and because everything needed to make home has been obliterated. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live/live-54-palestinians-killed-831-wounded-24-hours\">Follow Middle East Eye's live coverage of the Israel-Palestine war</a></strong></em></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Gaza has become, to borrow from <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/Nadera Shalhoub-Kervorkian, Militarization and Violence against Women in Conflict Zones: A Palestinian Case-Study (Cambridge University Press 2009) 196\">Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian</a>, a \"nowhere home\". And yet Gaza - Palestine - remains home. The concept of sumud captures this. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276865293_Exiled_at_Home_Writing_Return_and_the_Palestinian_Home\">Sumud </a>means rootedness in land, a \"stubborn standing\", a steadfast refusal to leave home and homeland, and resistance and defiance through acts of homemaking, of hospitality and accommodation, and of dreaming of home. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, despite the destruction of home in Gaza, it must be part of our activism and our resistance to showcase the beauty, creativity and art, the culture and design riches of Gaza and Gazans.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve said the word a lot, but what exactly does home mean? Home is much more than a place in which we live.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    \n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>It is a complex, multidimensional concept which comprises an array of feelings and experiences. It is at once a material, affective and imaginative space. In its most expansive meaning, home is a sense of being and belonging in the world: to <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276865293_Exiled_at_Home_Writing_Return_and_the_Palestinian_Home\">quote Shalhoub-Kevorkian </a>again, it is \"a psychological and epistemological space of yearning, and of radical thinking and belonging\".</p>\n\n<p>The process of making-home, of \"homing\", is one of \"becoming\", of carving out our own socio-spatial identity. This is of course why Palestinian homes have always been targets for destruction.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Home's complex role, both as a site of violence and control as well as agency and resistance, is important to understanding the mass destruction of home in Gaza</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For Palestinians, home is a place, a powerful idea and an organising force. It is homeland, memory and identity. As Shalhoub-Kevorkian and Sarah Ihmoud <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276865293_Exiled_at_Home_Writing_Return_and_the_Palestinian_Home\">write</a>, the Palestinian home is \"saturated\" with individual and collective, cultural and <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/Thembisa Waetjen, \u2018The \u201chome\u201d in homeland: Gender, national space, and Inkatha\u2019s politics of ethnicity\u2019 (1999) 22 Ethnic and Racial Studi\">political meanings</a>. Home is a place where history and memory are transmitted, preserving and continuing cultural and national identity and the idea of a Palestinian homeland. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The homeland may be an artificial construction - mobilised, for example, in discourses of nationalist exclusion and violence - but the concept of homeland remains critical for understanding <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/Thembisa Waetjen, \u2018The \u201chome\u201d in homeland: Gender, national space, and Inkatha\u2019s politics of ethnicity\u2019 (1999) 22 Ethnic and Racial Studi\">territorial claims</a>, modes of ethno-national, spatial control, and how space is \"planned, settled and transformed\", &nbsp;including the smaller space of home.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/doreen-massey-reader/place-called-home-1992/445FF56A4CC63F7D0324DC7B996EA999\">Feminists </a>have shown us that home is <a href=\"https://soas-repository.worktribe.com/output/353853/home-bait\">problematic</a>. But it is difficult to exorcise the positive valences of home - most of us look forward to going home, and we invite others to make themselves at home. Nonetheless, the ideal or idealised home that is safe, exclusive, bounded and static in time is far from the reality of home, which is contingent and provisional.</p>\n\n<p>It is better to think of home as a place of contest, negotiation and shifting boundaries; of thresholding, bordering and histories of becoming and of estrangement; and a dynamic process of re-articulation: of making, unmaking and remaking. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Despite the unprecedented level of home destruction taking place in Gaza, <a href=\"https://docs.un.org/en/S/RES/2735%20(2024)\">international law</a> has been unable to stop it. In fact, international law has little to say about home: what home means and what it is to lose a home in violent conflict.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>No protection</h3>\n\n<p>Home is not explicitly protected in international law. Home can be <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights\">derived from</a> or implied in particular provisions, such as the rights to housing, property and privacy. We see something like \"homeland\" in the recognition of indigenous peoples\u2019 distinctive spiritual connection to land. The <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/geneva-convention-relative-protection-civilian-persons-time-war\">laws of war </a>prohibit targeting \"civilian property\" and \"civilian objects\", which we can take to mean home. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Yet home is far from a derived experience. Home is real life. Home is embodied and emplaced. Home is multiple - most of us would say that home is in different places - and mobile; we carry it with us across place and time: home is present, past (nostalgia) and future (utopia). As <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/136787799900200303\">Sara Ahmed writes</a>, home is storytelling, colonialism, racial discrimination, class relations and the politics of gender. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And so it is that home, as a central aspect of liberation praxis, has remained<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/race-palestine-and-international-law/BFAC419AF622082D82D9D28BCAEE6D72\"> invisible</a> in modern international law, with its patriarchal conceptions of struggles for justice, self-determination and statehood, and its roots in colonial order.</p>\n\n<div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\">\n  <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/gaza-genocide-denial-should-be-criminalised-worldwide-why\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/gaza-protest-spain-san-sebastian-june-2025-ander-gillenea-afp.jpg.webp?itok=2U1jYAVO\" width=\"400\" />\n\n</a>  <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Why Gaza genocide denial should be criminalised worldwide</div>\n    <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/gaza-genocide-denial-should-be-criminalised-worldwide-why\">Read More \u00bb</a>\n</div>\n\n<p>But this does not mean that international law is inactive in the space of home. I argue that it is already present at home, shaping and defining the contours and conditions of home in myriad ways. In other words, international law does homemaking - and unmaking - work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is, for example, the international laws of war that provide for, and sustain, the legal architecture of occupation. Even if that occupation has been condemned by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in essence, that international legal framework opens the door to enter into and control Palestinian homes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There are also more subtle - metaphorical and philosophical - equivalences between home and international law that diagram its home unmaking work in Palestine. The nation-state is frequently analogised with home. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Claims to statehood, sovereignty, territory and self-determination are often grounded (physically and imaginatively) in the <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/%22The-heart-of-my-home%22-:-colonialism-environmental-damage-and-the-Nauru-case/oclc/1248018311\">language of home and homeland</a>. Home is the ultimate sovereign space - a place of exclusive belonging and universal order. We hear in international law\u2019s promise of statehood and self-determination the longing to be \"at home\" somewhere in the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And so it is that the repeated, repressive denial of Palestinian statehood and self-determination, and the refusal to recognise and create space for a Palestinian homeland, is channelled through and given <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv25wxbvf\">official form</a> by international legal processes, institutions and actors as they go about their homemaking work. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally and more explicitly on this point, Israel has deployed international law over the past 22 months to facilitate the unmaking of home in Gaza by calling on the laws of war to justify and authorise a shift in the classification of Gaza\u2019s homes from protected places to military targets.</p>\n\n<p>This makes international law complicit in home destruction while also drawing it in to a narrative about Palestinians as a people without a home, without connection to a \"<a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/UprootingsRegroundings-Questions-of-Home-and-Migration/Ahmed-Castada-Fortier-Sheller/p/book/9781859736296?srsltid=AfmBOorSZZVZ5FFyse2WGdzwWTjTlSPhYXjGEg-f2W05PJfLLwfIuN7g\">soil of significance</a>\", which of course is a dehumanising narrative Israel has been constructing and reconstructing for decades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>A precursor to genocide</h3>\n\n<p>With no direct protection for home, nor prohibition of its destruction in international law - and notwithstanding international law\u2019s complicity (intentional or otherwise) in the unmaking of home in Gaza - recently there have been calls for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/29/opinion/destruction-of-homes-crime-domicide.html\">domicide to be made a crime</a> under international law. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Some might argue that criminalising domicide is unnecessary because home destruction falls within <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/palestine\">existing categories</a> of international crime, such as war crimes. It might also be said that home destruction is comparable to a crime against humanity, where (as often happens) it results in forced transfer, apartheid or other inhumane acts. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Home destruction may also precipitate <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=genocied+middle+east+eye&amp;client=safari&amp;sca_esv=892b6d78acac2e62&amp;channel=mac_bm&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifMS91Ix-hgR3iXJrpDNQ9VY1viT2A%3A1755774646196&amp;source=hp&amp;ei=tv6maL2ZCYLHhbIP_IXZ0A4&amp;iflsig=AOw8s4IAAAAAaKcMxiIw5sb61weh1MtpWtt2DfZo-EMV&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9zNug4puPAxWCY0EAHfxCFuoQ4dUDCBo&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=genocied+middle+east+eye&amp;gs_lp=Egdnd3Mtd2l6IhhnZW5vY2llZCBtaWRkbGUgZWFzdCBleWVIvURQAFjXQnAGeACQAQCYAYcBoAH-FaoBBTE5LjExuAEDyAEA-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-QHCAg0QLhiABBjHARgKGK8BwgIHEAAYgAQYDcICChAAGIAEGMcDGA3CAgYQABgNGB7CAgcQIRigARgKmAMAkgcEOS4xMqAHrtEBsgcENC4xMrgH-A3CBwgwLjMuMTQuNMgHcA&amp;sclient=gws-wiz\">genocide</a>. In the ICJ\u2019s January 2024 order recognising Palestinians\u2019 right to be protected from genocide, the court mentioned \"home\" eight times in a <a href=\"https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/192/192-20240126-ord-01-00-en.pdf\">short, 29-page document</a>, underlining the link between the destruction of home and genocide.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Despite the unprecedented level of home destruction taking place in Gaza, international law has been unable to stop it</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/special-procedures/sr-housing\">link</a>, unfortunately, is not without historical precedent. In Myanmar and Rwanda, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, genocide and domicide were \"tightly entwined\". &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These are important legal and historical comparisons. They also provide an opening for the conversation that I think we first need to have about home, in which home is conceptualised in the richer sense that I have described, and a conversation about why it is that we might think about home through its absence or erasure. It is the latter where <a href=\"https://international-review.icrc.org/sites/default/files/reviews-pdf/2023-12/librarians-pick-scorched-earth-environmental-warfare-924.pdf\">domicide</a> comes in. The value of domicide is that it draws attention to the political nature of the homespace and the complexity of home destruction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Domicide can be <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/lril/article/12/2/131/7746072\">defined</a> as \"the deliberate destruction of home by human agency in the pursuit of specific goals, which causes suffering to the victims\".</p>\n\n<p>Like home, domicide is a multifaceted phenomenon with diverse temporalities, affective registers and modalities of loss. Domicide is home destruction that occurs again and again, often spanning different locations and incorporating different intents and methods. It is <a href=\"https://merip.org/2009/09/dismantling-the-matrix-of-control/\">operationalised</a> through the self-destruction of homes, denial of residency rights and rights of return, restriction of access to natural resources, discriminatory zoning and planning restrictions and deviant \"urbanisation\" programmes. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Domicidal processes, activities and operations may or may not result in the physical destruction of home. The point is that they render home uninhabitable and deny the conditions for homemaking - both materially and psychologically.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Perpetual upheaval</h3>\n\n<p>Domicide keeps a community <a href=\"https://merip.org/2009/09/dismantling-the-matrix-of-control/\">\"in a state of continual upheaval\"</a>, prohibited from resettling and making home in new places, living in a <a href=\"https://merip.org/2009/09/dismantling-the-matrix-of-control/\">\"constant uncertainty\"</a> and without a sense of permanence. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This conceptualisation marks a shift from domicide as a singular event or a \"one-off\" to a process that is neither linear, instant or finite, but one which unfolds and repeats. The repetition underscores the intentional and systematic element of domicide and the logic of violent erasure that drives it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Any legal approach to domicide will also need to make space for the emotional and affective dimensions of home destruction. This includes the destruction of collective memory and of connection to place and people, the loss of ontological security and belonging, and the psychological trauma that comes with losing home and the uncertainty of making another home.</p>\n\n<div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\">\n  <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/gaza-war-our-memories-home-will-never-die\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/Two%20girls%20watch%20the%20sun%20set%20atop%20a%20concrete%20water%20storage%20tank%20overlooking%20the%20Hamad%20Residential%20City%20complex%20in%20the%20north%20of%20Khan%20Yunis%20in%20the%20southern%20Gaza%20Strip%20on%20December%2022%2C%202024-afp_0.jpg.webp?itok=wj3UzXGB\" width=\"400\" />\n\n</a>  <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">War on Gaza: Our memories of home will never die</div>\n    <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/gaza-war-our-memories-home-will-never-die\">Read More \u00bb</a>\n</div>\n\n<p>Criminalising domicide under international law would not stop the destruction of home, though it may deter it. And to the extent that international law refuses to act on domicide, this could be interpreted as turning a blind eye, tacit authorisation, or as I have suggested, complicity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not domicide is ever criminalised, the concept alone provides an organising tool for decolonial and anti-imperial resistance in Palestine and elsewhere. Ignoring harms to home is not only unjust, it is also convenient for states and other actors for whom home destruction serves strategic ends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When home and its destruction is viewed through the richer, more complex lens that I have talked about, domicide becomes about more than legal accountability for perpetrators and redress for victims, while these remain important.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Domicide is about seeing the violence done through and to home in support of settler-colonialism, ethnic oppression, apartheid or genocide, and other acts that undermine the ability of people to make-home.</p>\n\n<p>It is about acknowledging the yearning for home and homeland and the violence done in the name of that yearning, often strategically by states and other groups and frequently by deploying law, including international law, as a tool to facilitate and legitimise it.</p>\n\n<p>I visited the <a href=\"https://warchildhood.org\">War Childhood Museum here in Sarajevo</a> before we began the tribunal. During the siege of Sarajevo,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Siege-of-Sarajevo\">65 percent</a> of the city\u2019s homes were destroyed. Sarajevo is a <a href=\"https://www.sah.org/publications/sah-blog/blog-detail/sah-blog/2022/07/08/a-city-that-doesn-t-forget-sarajevo-thirty-years-after-the-war\">\"city that does not forget\"</a>, and indeed, many of the artefacts in the museum elicit home as a vessel of memories, of sustenance for identity, and as a site of resistance to dispossession and dehumanisation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Who profits?</h3>\n\n<p>As a final note, we should also be looking at domicide in Palestine through larger <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0309132517735706\">geopolitical and geolegal lenses</a>. International law is just one among many other participants in what I call the \"global regime of unhoming\". This comprises all the institutions, systems, structures, arrangements and logics that determine whether Palestinians can (and cannot) make a home in the world and where.</p>\n\n<p>A larger view of domicide needs to consider the political economy of homemaking and unmaking: who profits, for example, from plans to rebuild Gaza? When international organisations say it will take millions of dollars and many years to rebuild, what is their agenda and do these statements not dangerously ease the way for expulsion from Gaza and permanent displacement?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Home in Gaza today is far from ordinary, but let us hope it will return to that</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To me, this is all part of the global regime of unhoming, which fuels a <a href=\"https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/the-politics-of-belonging/book229032\">\"politics of belonging\"</a> that has, for too long, divided the world into \"us\" and \"them\" - we, who are at-home, and them, Palestinians, who are made to feel not-at-home. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>International law\u2019s participation in unhoming does not mean that we have to abandon it or disengage from it. But we should examine its place in assemblages of power that are connected with home destruction and consider how its homemaking (and home-unmaking) work can be redirected towards more just and less violent outcomes; how we might transform and reimagine what international law is doing in the space of home.</p>\n\n<p>Home is a special place. But it also is, and should be, an ordinary place, full of ordinary, everyday things and practices. Home in Gaza today is far from ordinary, but let us hope it will return to that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><i>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.</i></p>\n</div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/gaza-extermination\" hreflang=\"en\">Gaza extermination</a></div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div>\n        <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\">\n    <div>Post Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\">\n    <div>Update Date</div>\n              <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\">\n    <div>Update Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n\n  </div>\n  \n</article>"}

He said that Haridopolos had not been responsive in a while.</p>\n\n<p>Ibrahim feels abandoned by the US government. He said America\u2019s policy of \u2018America First\u2019 may apply in other countries, but it did not seem to apply in Israel.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>'I keep everything inside me.

He weighed around 100 pounds at the time he was detained.</p>\n\n<p>He has heard reports that Mohammed gets one meal a day, sleeps on the floor and has a one-minute shower every few days. He also learned his son got scabies while in detention and has hurt his back sleeping on the floor.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI keep everything inside me. It\u2019s very difficult. When you go to eat, you wonder if your son is even getting anything to eat. When you go to sleep and you put your head on a pillow, you wonder if your son even has a pillow or a bed.

I told them he was eating well, so it didn\u2019t affect their well-being\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Ibrahim said that his other son, who lives in Florida, had come in July and had wanted to go to court, and had gone back home and told the rest of the family the full extent of what Mohammed was going through, which broke them.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    \n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<h3>'Violation of international law'</h3>\n\n<p>Detention facilities for Palestinian detainees are notoriously bad, and human rights groups say conditions have deteriorated since 7 October.</p>\n\n<p>Miranda Cleland, advocacy officer for NGO Defence for Children International, said that Israeli forces had intensified their arrest operations throughout the occupied West Bank, placing more and more children in military detention, including many without charge or trial after 7 October.</p>\n\n<p>Cleland says that their lawyers are regularly blocked from visiting Palestinian child detainees, and if they are allowed into prisons, at times, they are only given a few minutes to speak to them.</p>\n\n<div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\">\n  <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/palestinians-gaza-enduring-hell-israeli-custody-prisoner-monitors-say\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/kziot-prison-Negev-israel-detention-palestinians-january-2025-afp.jpg.webp?itok=4Sh3OinJ\" width=\"400\" />\n\n</a>  <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Palestinians from Gaza 'enduring hell' in Israeli custody, prisoner monitors say</div>\n    <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/palestinians-gaza-enduring-hell-israeli-custody-prisoner-monitors-say\">Read More \u00bb</a>\n</div>\n\n<p>\u201cChildren we have interviewed after their release have reported brutal torture, frequent beatings, rotten food, and complete isolation from the outside world.

Town Holocaust and Genocide Centre, which sits in the heart of South Africa's \"mother city\",&nbsp;is facing accusations of complicity in the devastating 22-month-long war, after adopting what its detractors call a shameful position of silence.</p>\n\n<p>More than&nbsp;200,000 Palestinians have been killed or wounded since Israel went to war in Gaza in October 2023, with recent reports, based on Israeli&nbsp;military intelligence data, claiming more than 80 percent of those killed in the enclave until May of this year were civilians.</p>\n\n<p>Kelly-Jo Bluen, a genocide scholar and member of South African Jews For a Free Palestine (SAJFP), said that by choosing to remain silent on the horrors unfolding in Gaza, the centre had \"flagrantly misappropriated the memory of our ancestors who resisted, fled and died in the Nazi Holocaust in Europe to participate in the most egregious genocidal complicity by genocide denialism.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"It has brought shame not only to its curatorial and managerial team, but onto the community,\" Bluen told Middle East Eye.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    \n<!--

href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/us/holocaust-museums-israel-hamas-war.html\">other Holocaust centres</a> around the world, the Cape Town Holocaust and Genocide Centre has been under intense scrutiny over how it has responded to the carnage unfolding in Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>For more than a year, <a href=\"https://sajfp.org.za/statement-on-sajfp-picket-at-the-cape-town-holocaust-and-genocide-centre-cthgc/\">activists in South Africa </a>have said they have attempted&nbsp;to engage with the centre for it to change track,&nbsp;including attempts at dialogue and raising public awareness over the situation in Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>However, they said that not only had the leadership refused to acknowledge that a genocide was taking place, the museum also ignored calls to collaborate with the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) on an exhibition showing both the destruction as well as the resilience of Palestinians in Gaza.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>According to the activists, the centre said it was waiting for a final judgement from an international tribunal on the crime of genocide in Gaza <a href=\"https://groundup.org.za/article/calls-for-holocaust-centre-to-recognise-genocide-in-gaza/\">before</a> it would adjust its educational programming.</p>\n\n<p>Jakub Nowakowski, the director of the Holocaust and Genocide Centre, told MEE that&nbsp;the decision did not \"stem from indifference or a lack of compassion, but rather from our long-standing policy not to incorporate ongoing conflicts into our exhibitions\".<br />\n<br />\n\"We are deeply disturbed by the violence and human suffering we are all witnessing, and we share the hope that this war will end as soon as possible,\" he said, adding that the centre maintained this approach for other conflicts.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    \n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Nowakoswki maintains that the museum's responsibility is not to offer political or legal judgments in \"real time\" but to instead equip visitors with the tools to make their own decisions by looking at the past.</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: start; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;\">\n<p>\"The moral challenge lies precisely in the fact that each of these tragedies deserves recognition, and our role as a museum cannot be to adjudicate between them in real time,\" he added.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: start; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;\">\n<p>Activists and scholars told MEE that the centre's silence over Israel's assault on Gaza rendered it a bystander, and that it could therefore be seen as a collaborator to the very crimes it urges visitors to stand up to within its own walls.</p>\n\n<p>\"If a Holocaust Museum remains silent, or worse, goes into denial while Palestinians face extermination, what purpose does it serve?\" Usuf&nbsp;Chikte, the coordinator for the PSC in Cape Town, told MEE.</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: start; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;\">\n<p>As a Holocaust museum located in South Africa, the activists said, the centre had the unique opportunity to incorporate the story of Palestinian erasure as part of a larger curriculum of racial supremacy that characterised the policies of Nazi Germany and apartheid South Africa, as well as the state of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>They pointed out that whereas the centre carefully connects the conditions of apartheid South Africa to the treatment of Jews during Nazi Germany without ever overstating it, it completely ignores both the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/nakba\">Nakba</a> - the forced displacement of Palestinians in 1948 that culminated in the creation of Israel - and the charge of apartheid against Israel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Whereas academics have been using apartheid since the 1990s to describe Israel, several international human rights groups, including <a href=\"https://www.btselem.org/topic/apartheid\">Israeli groups</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2017/3/18/un-report-israel-has-established-an-apartheid-regime\">UN investigators</a>, have since also proscribed Israeli policies of dispossession, discrimination and political repression as befitting the label, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The erasure of these dimensions from a centre that seeks to use the Holocaust as an entry point to discuss genocide and crimes against humanity,&nbsp;activists say, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;stunning eschewal of institutional responsibility and stimulates unease over the centre's purpose as a front for Israeli policy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n  <figure class=\"media-block\">\n  <div class=\"group-inner\">\n    <div alt=\"Cape Town Genocide and

awaiting a tribunal to declare the situation in Gaza a genocide before it would do so, Chikte said that the&nbsp;International Court of Justice (ICJ) had already described Israel's actions as amounting to \"plausible\" genocide - an action itself that triggers a series of obligations for states and corporations around the world.</p>\n\n<p>According to Chikte, the centre ought to be helping articulate a plan of action, even spearheading calls for accountability, but was instead succumbing to Israeli tactics of \"whataboutery\" as a means to justify inaction.</p>\n\n<p>\"Selective remembrance reeks of hypocrisy and signals complicity.

It doesn't even have a name. But it has already&nbsp;received more than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/collectivnews/status/1957156235452527034\" target=\"_blank\">800,000</a>&nbsp;sign-ups.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Polling this week found that a third of 2024 Labour voters would consider voting for a Corbyn-Sultana-led party, as well as over a quarter of Labour members.</p>\n\n<p>This week, Middle East Eye sat down with Corbyn in London's Finsbury Park for an exclusive and wide-ranging interview.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    \n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Corbyn discussed the formation of the new party, its electoral ambitions, challenging the Labour government and <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk\">Britain's</a> involvement in <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel\">Israel's</a> <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\">genocide in Gaza</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The full conversation is available to watch on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRS-Jxw3l2s\">YouTube</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>On establishing a new party</h3>\n\n<p>The basis of the new party is the Independent Alliance: a collection of six independent MPs that have a larger grouping in parliament than Reform UK. Zarah Sultana is a recent addition to the group, which was formed after the July 2024 election.</p>\n\n<p>\"We have a broadly similar political direction,\" Corbyn explains.</p>\n\n<p>\"On Gaza, there is no disagreement at all. Generally, on economic and social justice issues, in the same direction....We all work together with each other. We share out strategies of how to ask questions [in parliament] and do things.\"</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>He adds: \"If something arises where we're not all of the same mind, fine. We make our own points. We don't attack each other.\"</p>\n\n<p>A founding conference for the new party, where&nbsp;members will vote on a name, among other issues, is likely to be held in November.</p>\n\n<p>\"Hundreds of thousands of people have signed up. They won't all become members, but many will. And it's exciting.\"</p>\n\n<p>Corbyn lays out five principles which he said are behind the party. The first is peace: \"Therefore, no bombs to Israel to drop on Gaza, for example.\"</p>\n\n<p>The other principles \"are about economic justice within our society. They are about dealing with the worst vestiges of poverty within our society\".</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    \n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>\"They are about environmental sustainability, and they are about public ownership of public service,\" Corbyn says.</p>\n\n<p>\"But it's also about the kind of creativity and democracy we are,\" he adds. \"So when you bring people together in a creative endeavour, through local forums and grassroots democracy, you defeat the far right, you defeat the racists.</p>\n\n<p>\"Nigel Farage needs to be very aware that we're out there and we're offering something different, which he can't. We're offering hope.\"</p>\n\n<h3>Co-leadership</h3>\n\n<p>One of the more unusual elements of the party is the ambiguity surrounding its leadership. Although much media commentary tends to present Corbyn and Sultana as co-leaders, this hasn't been set in stone.</p>\n\n<p>Does Corbyn see himself as leader? \"I'm a young man!\" he jokes. Then, more seriously, he suggests he will only take on a leadership role if&nbsp;the membership wishes him to.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    \n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>\"I want to see change,\" he says. \"I want to see social justice. I want to see a transformation in our society. That's what I've done all my life.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"That's what I'll do for the rest of my life. Whatever job people want me to do, I'll do it,\" he adds.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>'I want to see change. I want to see social justice. I want to see a transformation in our society'</p>\n\n<p><em>- Jeremy Corbyn</em>&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One major issue that has dogged the party is the sense that Corbyn and Sultana aren't really in lockstep. For one thing, Corbyn took over a day to follow up her initial announcement of a new party in July, and his statement was much more ambiguous.</p>\n\n<p>Then, over the weekend, an interview Sultana gave to the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/im-anti-zionist-zarah-sultana-lays-out-vision-new-left-wing-party\">N</a><a href=\"https://newleftreview.org/sidecar/posts/the-alternative\">ew Left Review</a> was published in which she levelled serious criticism against his leadership of Labour.</p>\n\n<p>Sultana suggested Corbyn had capitulated by adopting the controversial IHRA definition of antisemitism, which <a href=\"https://newleftreview.org/sidecar/posts/the-alternative\">critics</a> say has been used to equate anti-Zionism with antisemitism.</p>\n\n<p>\"I think it wasn't really necessary for her to bring all that up in the interview, but that's what she decided to do,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>\"The party did adopt the IHRA definition. Personally, I was more in favour of the Jerusalem Declaration, which is simply saying that antisemitism is wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\"It is wrong to be antisemitic, and it is perfectly possible to discuss the politics and behaviour of the state of Israel without being antisemitic.</p>\n\n<p>\"People do that all the time. Indeed, many people in Israel do that all the time, and so our party will have a resolutely anti-racist position.\"</p>\n\n<p>Corbyn said he would like the new party to adopt a \"general declaration of respect for all communities, all ethnicities, all languages, all faiths and no faiths\".</p>\n\n<h3>The new party's electoral ambitions</h3>\n\n<p>Despite apparent disagreements between the party's leading figures, it has regularly polled above 10 percent.</p>\n\n<p>Coming alongside the rise of the right-wing populist party Reform UK and the collapse of the Conservatives, the party could win scores of seats and accelerate the destruction of the old two-party system. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Corbyn says even Labour ministers should be worried. One of them is Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who Corbyn recalls \"was never terribly helpful to me\" when he was leader.</p>\n\n<p>\"He had a quote ready for every occasion, which was always condemnatory [and] undermining of me,\" Corbyn says.</p>\n\n<p>Streeting came close to losing his seat in 2024 to an independent British-Palestinian candidate, Leanne Mohamad, who has since continued to campaign in the constituency, Ilford North, including alongside Corbyn.</p>\n\n<div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-the-big-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\">\n  <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/big-story/ilford-north-leanne-mohamad-and-british-left-set-their-sights-labour\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/leanne-mohamad-speaks-event-4-jul-2025-thanseela-abdul-kabeer-mee.jpg.webp?itok=ZvlcIndK\" width=\"400\" />\n\n</a>  <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">In Ilford North, Leanne Mohamad and the British left set their sights on Labour</div>\n    <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/big-story/ilford-north-leanne-mohamad-and-british-left-set-their-sights-labour\">Read More \u00bb</a>\n</div>\n\n<p>\"I've been in Ilford with Leanne Mohamad and we had a huge public meeting.

That was an example of the coalition of support she's put together in Ilford.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"So I would think Streeting has a great deal to be worried about there,\" he muses.</p>\n\n<p>\"But maybe he'll be looking for another constituency.

Andrew Feinstein, a close Corbyn ally, stood as an independent and significantly cut into Starmer's majority in his central London seat in 2024, winning 7,312 votes.</p>\n\n<p>\"Andrew is a formidable campaigner and [has a] very interesting political background: a former African National Congress MP in South Africa and Jewish,\" says Corbyn.</p>\n\n<p>\"Many of his family were lost in the Holocaust. He has enormous empathy with people under stress and under pressure, and is very strong in support for the Palestinian people in Gaza, in the West Bank.</p>\n\n<p>\"So very, very hard for Starmer to oppose.\"</p>\n\n<p>The votes Feinstein won in 2024, Corbyn suggests, should worry the prime minister: \"Traditionally in British elections, the leader of the party, or prime minister, gets almost a free pass in their constituency.\"</p>\n\n<p>Could Britain see the end of the two-party system?</p>\n\n<p>\"Yes,\" Corbyn says confidently and without hesitation, noting that the Tories and Labour are polling at around 20 percent each or thereabouts.</p>\n\n<p>\"Traditionally the two-party system has usually attracted up to 90 percent of the vote to two parties. I think it's time for proportional representation.\"</p>\n\n<p>Corbyn adds that he wants even more reform to the political system than that: \"Let's abolish the House of Lords. Let's just get rid of it, and have a senate of 100, 200, that sort of number.\"</p>\n\n<h3>Cameron's threat to ICC</h3>\n\n<p>Corbyn also gave his views on Israel's genocide in Gaza, which he believes Britain is complicit in.</p>\n\n<p>He called for the Labour&nbsp;government to investigate reports that David Cameron, the&nbsp;former UK prime minister, threatened the International Criminal Court (ICC) chief prosecutor Karim Khan while he was serving as foreign secretary in the previous government.</p>\n\n<p>Middle East Eye&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/david-cameron-threatened-withdraw-uk-icc-over-israel-war-crimes-probe\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>&nbsp;in June that on 23 April 2024, Cameron privately threatened Khan that the UK would defund and withdraw from the ICC if it issued warrants for Israeli leaders.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this month, French newspaper&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/karim-khan-le-monde-investigates-campaign-against-icc-chief\" target=\"_blank\">Le Monde</a>&nbsp;also reported that Cameron threatened the prosecutor with Britain's withdrawal from the ICC.</p>\n\n<p>MEE revealed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/david-cameron-threatened-withdraw-uk-icc-over-israel-war-crimes-probe\" target=\"_blank\">details</a>&nbsp;of the call based on information from several sources - including former staff in Khan's office familiar with the conversation and who have seen the minutes of the meeting.</p>\n\n<div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\">\n  <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/david-cameron-threatened-withdraw-uk-icc-over-israel-war-crimes-probe\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/000_34WK9PQ.jpg.webp?itok=D3GO6SNn\" width=\"400\" />\n\n</a>  <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Exclusive: David Cameron threatened to withdraw UK from ICC over Israel war crimes probe</div>\n    <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/david-cameron-threatened-withdraw-uk-icc-over-israel-war-crimes-probe\">Read More \u00bb</a>\n</div>\n\n<p>Corbyn said the report was particularly serious because Britain was one of the countries which set up the ICC.</p>\n\n<p>He said he was in parliament when it voted on the Rome Statute, the ICC's founding charter.</p>\n\n<p>\"There&nbsp;was opposition from some Conservatives who wanted the armed forces exempt from it,\" Corbyn recalls.</p>\n\n<p>\"But that didn\u2019t happen, it went through in the way it should have done, and we are part of the ICC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\"And so the idea that the foreign secretary would challenge the chief prosecutor, who\u2019s a man who should be treated with respect, with great integrity, and in a very, very difficult job - to be threatened by one of the original signatories [of the Rome Statute] is absolutely appalling and shocking\".</p>\n\n<p>In June, Cameron did not respond to MEE\u2019s requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>\"He's a very busy man!\" Corbyn says, with more than a hint of sarcasm.</p>\n\n<p>Cameron, now a Conservative peer, was the British prime minister between 2010 and 2016. Corbyn was leader of the opposition from 2015 to 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Corbyn warned&nbsp;that threatening the ICC prosecutor is a criminal offence, noting that if he as an MP attempted to influence a British judge, \"that judge would probably haul me straight before the court, as being in contempt of court. And he would be right, or she would be right, to do that\".</p>\n\n<p>\"So the same principle must apply in international law as well. And so Cameron, in a sense, is in contempt of the ICC process,\" Corbyn says, adding&nbsp;that the former prime minister \"at some point is going to have to answer questions about this\".</p>\n\n<h3>The Gaza Tribunal</h3>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, Corbyn submitted a bill in parliament for a public inquiry into Britain's involvement in Israel's military operations in Gaza. Unsurprisingly, the government blocked the bill.</p>\n\n<p>Now, he is organising a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=gaza+tribunal+corbyn&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB1175&amp;oq=gaza+tribunal+corbyn&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTINCAEQABiGAxiABBiKBTINCAIQABiGAxiABBiKBTINCAMQABiGAxiABBiKBTINCAQQABiGAxiABBiKBTIHCAUQABjvBTIHCAYQABjvBTIGCAcQRRg80gEIMzQ0NmowajeoAgCwAgA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#:~:text=Jeremy%20Corbyn%20announces,jeremy%2Dcorbyn%2Da...\">Gaza Tribunal</a> of his own.</p>\n\n<p>\"We have on 4 and 5 of September, for two days in Church House in Westminster, an open public inquiry,\" Corbyn says.</p>\n\n<p>\"It will be live on YouTube and lots of other platforms and channels, and that inquiry will be hearing voices from people in Gaza, in the West Bank, aid workers, journalists, lawyers, international legal experts.</p>\n\n<p>\"There will be a small group of assessors who will assess all the evidence and it will all be published.\"</p>\n\n<p>What impact could this have? \"It can't change government policy in and of itself,\" he concedes.</p>\n\n<p>\"But it can and will create a debate and a narrative about the dishonesty of the way governments have behaved by continuing to supply weapons to Israel, knowing full well those bombs are going to drop on schools and kill children.\"</p>\n\n<p>One of the key issues the tribunal will examine is the secrecy surrounding British spy planes that have flown over Gaza.</p>\n\n<div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\">\n  <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/exclusive-uk-wont-say-if-spy-planes-captured-footage-israeli-attacks-uk-charity-workers\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/000_642E6MW.jpg.webp?itok=oEE3AHh7\" width=\"400\" />\n\n</a>  <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Exclusive: UK won't say if spy planes captured footage of Israeli attacks on UK charity workers</div>\n    <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/exclusive-uk-wont-say-if-spy-planes-captured-footage-israeli-attacks-uk-charity-workers\">Read More \u00bb</a>\n</div>\n\n<p>Aircraft from the Royal Air Force (RAF) have conducted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/british-mp-suggests-uk-spy-planes-over-gaza-violated-spirit-ceasefire\" target=\"_blank\">hundreds of</a>&nbsp;surveillance flights over Gaza throughout&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel\" target=\"_blank\">Israel's&nbsp;</a>war on the besieged enclave.</p>\n\n<p>\"What are these flights for?\" Corbyn questions. \"There's an awful lot of them.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Ministry of Defence&nbsp;has repeatedly insisted that the surveillance flights over Gaza are in support of \"hostage rescue\". Corbyn doesn't buy this.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's a very strange way of helping a hostage release, to take photographs from the air,\" he says. \"If the hostage is being held in tunnels under Gaza, a photograph isn't going to help of the ground above. It's nonsense.</p>\n\n<p>\"I've always felt that the real purpose was to supply information to Israel, to know where to bomb.</p>\n\n<p>\"If that argument can be sustained, then Britain is even more complicit in the genocidal acts of bombing schools, hospitals and people's homes.\"</p>\n\n<p>The veteran MP has often been accused by political opponents of focusing too much on foreign policy issues irrelevant to his constituents.</p>\n\n<p>This is nonsense, Corbyn says. Foreign and domestic policy are intimately connected. More money for weapons and war abroad means less for caring for people at home.</p>\n\n<p>He gestures around Finsbury Park.</p>\n\n<p>\"If you get up and say, 'What would you prefer, an F-35 jet or personal independence payments for people with disabilities?' I don't think there are too many people in this park that would go for the F-35.\"</p>\n\n<p>His is a radically different type of politics to that represented by the major parties of Labour and the Conservatives.</p>\n\n<p>It's unclear how the new party will shape up.

The company said <a href=\"https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1748/intel-and-trump-administration-reach-historic-agreement-to\">in a press release</a> that the government will \"make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock.\" It adds that the equity stake will be funded by $5.7 billion previously earmarked for Intel as part of the CHIPS act, and $3.2 billion awarded as part of the Secure Enclave program. Intel had previously recieved $2.2 billion in CHIPS grants, bringing the government's total spend on the chipmaker to $11.1 billion. The government paid $20.47 per share, so the $8.9 billion investment is equivalent to a 9.9 percent stake in the company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It's important to note that the government investing in Intel is not the same thing as receiving free money, it's the exact opposite.

But after going to Samsung's new headquarters in New Jersey, I can attest that it is truly a sight to behold.</p>\n<p>Now, before we get to the TV itself, it's probably a good idea to dive into what's going on with Samsung's latest panel tech. In many ways, Micro RGB is a step up from current Mini LED screens. On a technical level, the Micro LEDs and the self-emissive pixels of Samsung's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-the-wall-virtual-movie-studio-121524064.html\">The Wall</a> probably remain the more sophisticated end goal for next-gen TVs.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>At its core, Micro RGB is still based on LCD tech, the difference is that instead of using blue or white backlighting like a lot of sets today, it features individually controlled red, green and blue Micro LEDs (hence the name Micro RGB) to produce an even wider range of colors. The result is that Samsung claims this is the first TV to cover 100 percent of the BT.2020 standard. For context, that covers more than 75 percent of the visible spectrum and has an even wider color range than what you get from DCI-P3, which is one of the most commonly used high-end standards for modern filmmaking.</p>\n\n<p>In person, that means the TV can produce stunningly rich and vivid colors that put Samsung's other top-tier TVs to shame, including the new <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-expands-super-big-tv-lineup-115-inch-neo-qled-4k-tv/\"><ins>Neo QLED QN90F</ins></a> which starts at a whopping $26,999. Like its sibling, Samsung's Micro RGB TV is only available in one size (115 inches) and has a similar design, while its panel features a 144Hz refresh rate and a matte glare-free coating. But that's kind of where the similarities end, because this new flagship model features four times the number of dimming zones. Furthermore, because the Micro RGB LEDs require more computing power to manage all those pixels, Samsung had to create a new RGB Engine AI processor to properly control everything.</p>\n<p>In short, this is a lot of words to describe what might be the best-looking TV I've ever seen. While I only got to view some demo footage (which admittedly is designed to make the set look its best), I couldn't help but appreciate the sheer intensity of the hues and shades on display. When the video loop shifted to primarily blue and green scenes, the TV's color depth was almost overwhelming. That said, due to the immense size of the panel, when you get up close, it's easy to see individual pixels. However, when you're sitting in its sweet spot (about 11.5 feet from the display), everything looks ridiculously sharp and overflows with detail. And even for those off-center, there appeared to be no falloff in brightness or saturation.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"While Samsung's $26,999 Neo QLED QN90F boasts a price tag that's nearly as expensive as the $29,999 Micro RGB TV, there's still a very obvious difference in color. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/09ec1af0-7f8d-11f0-b7f7-a298a5d62c2f\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" /><figcaption>While Samsung's $26,999 Neo QLED QN90F boasts a price tag that's nearly as expensive as the $29,999 Micro RGB TV, there's still a very obvious difference in color.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Now, of course, the major downside of Samsung's new Micro RGB TV is that at $29,999, it makes everything but The Wall (which starts at a cool $40,000) seem cheap. But the funny thing is that when compared to the Neo QLED QN90F, which Samsung also had on display in a nearby room, the difference in quality and color was immediately obvious. This sort of makes me wonder why anyone with super deep pockets would even consider the latter just to save a few thousand dollars, because when you see them in person, there's no doubt which set is superior.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the Micro RGB's full glory doesn't translate across the internet due to the much more limited specs of the web. It's one of those things you need to see for yourself to fully grasp. But if you're the kind of person with enough money that you don't need to care about price tags, Samsung's latest flagship should be an immediate contender as the centerpiece in your mansion.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-new-29999-micro-rgb-tv-looks-ridiculously-good-194629549.html?src=rss"}

That said, the shared photos (including the one embedded above) are more convincing than usual.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-much-will-the-iphone-17-cost\">How much will the iPhone 17 cost?</h2>\n<p>Apple's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-to-invest-another-100-billion-into-the-us-to-avoid-tariffs-210250020.html\">announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners</a> seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-original-nintendo-switch-is-about-to-get-more-expensive-in-the-us-170646701.html\">Switch consoles</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/nikon-joins-other-camera-manufacturers-in-raising-prices-due-to-tariffs-120011854.html\">high-end cameras</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/sonos-is-raising-prices-this-year-to-make-up-for-tariff-expenses-123031336.html\">Sonos speakers</a>. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an &quot;upgrade.&quot; Consider this recent rumor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/will-iphone-17-pro-start-at-256gb-storage/\">posted by <em>MacRumors</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>from a leaker known as &quot;<a href=\"https://weibo.com/u/5143897135\">Instant Digital</a>,&quot; suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/30/iphone-17-price-increase-expected/\">price increase of $50</a>, Apple could at least pitch it as a &quot;better value.&quot; That said, the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/every-macbook-air-now-starts-with-16gb-of-ram-at-no-extra-cost-150041320.html\">doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers</a> from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 \u2014 but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-when-will-the-iphone-17s-be-announced\">When will the iPhone 17 series be announced?</h2>\n<p>Most years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/apple-iphone-17-event-set-september-9/\"><em>MacRumors </em>highlighted</a> a story originally reported by <a href=\"https://www.iphone-ticker.de/iphone-17-vorstellung-wohl-am-9-verkaufsstart-am-19-september-261445/\">iphone-ticker.de</a> that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.</p>\n<p>It's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-reportedly-wants-to-split-up-the-iphones-release-schedule-164737099.html\">split</a> into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-new-iphone-17-lineup-include\">What will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?</h2>\n<p>Design leaks suggest that Apple is building an <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-said-to-be-working-on-a-significantly-thinner-iphone-180823565.html\">ultra-thin smartphone</a>, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/this-year-could-bring-the-iphone-air-and-an-entry-level-ipad-with-apple-intelligence-175059162.html\">reported</a> in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16e-review-whats-your-acceptable-compromise-020016288.html\">iPhone 16e</a>. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.</p>\n<p>An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/iphone-17-air-titanium-rumor/\">indicated</a> that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.</p>\n<p>Additionally, an August 4 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/04/iphone-17-air-battery-half-thickness-17-pro/\"><em>MacRumors </em>report</a> says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick \u2014 half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the <a href=\"https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=223958615195&amp;navType=by\">Korean-language Naver blog</a>, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, <em>MacRumors</em> notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)</p>\n<p>On a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/iphone-17-pro-leak-aluminum-chassis/\">according to <em>MacRumors</em></a>. Originally <a href=\"https://majinbuofficial.com/iphone-17-pro-antennas-repositioned-around-the-camera-module/\">posted by leaker Majin Bu</a>, the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. <em>MacRumors</em> says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight.</p>\n<p>That same leaker (Majin Bu), whom <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/iphone-17-pro-antenna-rumor/\"><em>MacRumors </em></a>classifies as a &quot;hit-or-miss leaker,&quot; suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual <a href=\"https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1954890746693312762\">posted a render on X</a> that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.</p>\n<p>Each new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width &quot;camera island&quot; on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the <a href=\"https://x.com/Skyfops/status/1949936265232888057\">purported iPhone 17 &quot;spotted in the wild.&quot;</a> The pics, highlighted on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/28/iphone-17-pro-possibly-spotted-in-the-wild/\"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.</p>\n<div id=\"a462ba8164d54c5a8ac8626b1540fe2f\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29 <a href=\"https://t.co/iS3PtKWqxJ\">pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ</a></p>\u2014 Fox Pupy \ud83e\udd8a\ud83e\udde1 (@Skyfops) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Skyfops/status/1949936265232888057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 28, 2025</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>The iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/a-599-iphone-16e-is-a-cruel-joke-200507275.html\">a surprisingly high price point</a>, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. <em>Bloomberg</em> said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 \u2014 likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.</p>\n<p>We've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2849423/iphone-17-colors-confirmed-see-all-of-apples-2026-options-right-here.html\"><em>Macworld</em></a> reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.</p>\n<p>On July 30, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/iphone-17-dummies-just-leaked-in-all-colors-and-theres-a-bold-new-signature-hue\"><em>Tom's Guide</em></a> highlighted an X post from <a href=\"https://x.com/SonnyDickson/status/1950325609957380405\">Sonny Dickson</a> \u2014 a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information \u2014 showing &quot;dummy&quot; iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned <em>Macworld</em> story. While these are literally just mock-ups \u2014 not real, leaked iPhones \u2014 it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.</p>\n<p>To add the the rumors, a Weibo leaker known as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/\">Digital Chat Station</a> suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/18/iphone-17e-rumored-to-gain-new-design-and-more/\"><em>MacRumors</em> reports</a>. According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. However, it's important to note this report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16e-review-whats-your-acceptable-compromise-020016288.html\">iPhone 16e</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-new-ios-be-like\">What will iOS 26 be like?</h2>\n<p>Apple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-public-beta-is-live-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-iphone-features-and-how-to-use-them-135749325.html\">iOS 26</a>.</p>\n<p>On the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html\">scaling down</a> the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.</p>\n<p>The feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">freeze FaceTime video</a> if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.</p>\n<p>iOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-will-at-long-last-let-you-customize-snooze-times-on-alarms-in-ios-26-190001600.html\">nine minute snooze alarm</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The next iOS is now available as a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-to-install-the-ios-18-public-beta-202938588.html\">public beta</a>. Here are our initial impressions of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html\">Liquid Glass design</a> and other new features. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-released-ios-26-public-beta-heres-the-list-of-compatible-iphones-that-can-download-it-today-191854620.html\">iOS 26 is compatible</a> with all models back through iPhone 11.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-other-products-are-expected-to-be-released-alongside-the-iphone-17\">What other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?</h2>\n<p>If Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html\">watchOS 26</a>, of course.) Other possibilities \u2014 and this is, again, speculation \u2014 could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218-130048292.html\">last big update in 2022</a>) and maybe new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apples-next-airtag-is-coming-in-2025-with-privacy-improvements-173028439.html\">AirTags trackers</a> (first released in 2021).</p>\n<p>The Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/every-apple-secret-that-leaked-yesterday/\"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/new-apple-tv-coming-later-this-year-with-a17-pro-chip/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/homepod-mini-new-chip/\">HomePod mini</a>, new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 \u2014 if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/everything-apple-announced-during-its-unofficial-mac-week-210115997.html\">M4 Macs</a>), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 22, 2025:</strong> Added new details about the colors of the rumored TechWoven case.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 20, 2025, 7:12PM ET:</strong> Added new rumor about potential TechWoven case for iPhone 17 series.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 18, 2025, 6:23PM ET: </strong>Added new rumor about the iPhone 17e potentially having the Dynamic Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 15, 2025, 2:05PM ET:</strong> Added new rumor about the all-aluminum chassis on the iPhone 17.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET:</strong> Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET:</strong> Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET:</strong> Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET:</strong> Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET:</strong> Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET:</strong> Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET:</strong> Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET:</strong> Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET:</strong> Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: </strong>Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.</p>\n<p><em>Katie Teague contributed to this story.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-release-date-ios-26-features-and-everything-else-to-know-about-apples-upcoming-lineup-153024576.html?src=rss"}

I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html\">taking screenshots</a> is way better in the new operating system \u2014 Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html\">preview of the iOS 26 public beta release</a>, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html\">Liquid Glass</a>, the translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-26-beta-preview-spotlights-time-to-shine-171700779.html\">macOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html\">iPadOS</a> and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/wwdc-2025-everything-apple-announced-including-ios-26-liquid-glass-design-and-more-171718030.html\">WWDC keynote</a> on June 9.</p>\n<p>After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Siri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant \u2014 first promised at WWDC 2024 \u2014 is delayed until some point \"<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html\">in the coming year</a>,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-chatgpt-claude-siri/\">basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models</a> like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-reportedly-has-a-stripped-down-ai-chatbot-to-compete-with-chatgpt-in-the-works-164345473.html\">'stripped-down' AI chatbot</a> to rival ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>With each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html\">new AirPods gesture</a> we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">freeze your video if it detects nudity</a>. With the release of the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes\">iOS 26 developer beta 5</a>, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/ios-26-beta-5-features/\"><em>MacRumors </em>reports</a>. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-is-releasing-ios-26-this-fall-heres-the-full-list-of-compatible-iphones-191854795.html\">eligible to download iOS 26 </a>(both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-is-ios-26\">What is iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>The current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it \u2014 version 18.6.1 was released to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apples-redesigned-blood-oxygen-monitoring-feature-hits-apple-watches-in-the-us-today-131558485.html\">restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring</a> functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-just-dropped-a-security-update-for-all-its-platforms-194528494.html\">Apple released 18.6.2</a> to address a vulnerability related to image processing. Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/22/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-6/\"><em>MacRumors reports</em></a>, which means it can no longer be installed on your iPhone due to a \"server-side software verification check.\" That's pretty normal when newer versions are available to download.</p>\n<p>But don't expect to see iOS 19 soon \u2014 or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"a list of the new OSes\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/29bbb6f0-4555-11f0-b2de-ada42a83075d\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>It's official, we're moving to iOS 26.

Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html\">new Liquid Glass design</a> was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year \u2014 the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.</p>\n<p>So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"<a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=86b7b54f-7ccd-4fbb-a927-09c327b93cbc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=new+translucent+material&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8wNi9hcHBsZS1lbGV2YXRlcy10aGUtaXBob25lLWV4cGVyaWVuY2Utd2l0aC1pb3MtMjYvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NmI3YjU0Zi03Y2NkLTRmYmItYTkyNy0wOWMzMjdiOTNjYmMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzcm9vbS8yMDI1LzA2L2FwcGxlLWVsZXZhdGVzLXRoZS1pcGhvbmUtZXhwZXJpZW5jZS13aXRoLWlvcy0yNi8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVivyXXsD7DiKwA3X-v-YLSp-mKPz8KpUrb1ctVS4Hji&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F06%2Fapple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26%2F\">new translucent material</a>\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some \u2014 including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar \u2014 like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-liquid-glass-is-windows-vista-done-well-181954910.html\">Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs</a> from nearly twenty years ago.</p>\n<p>That said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html\">has already incorporated some user feedback</a> into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-26-will-bring-apples-new-liquid-glass-ui-to-your-desktop-174149070.html\">the new macOS Tahoe 26</a> on your desktop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-are-the-new-and-notable-features-of-ios-26\">What are the new and notable features of iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:</p>\n<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages:</strong> iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Polls in group chats:</strong> Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.</p>\n<p><strong>Filtering unknown senders in Messages:</strong> If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual Intelligence:</strong> Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html\">screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence</a> to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.</p>\n<p><strong>Photos tabs are back:</strong> For anyone who's still frustrated with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-apple-redesigned-its-photos-app-around-customization-120038901.html\">Photos changes made last year</a>, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: </strong>A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature</a> that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-customize-your-iphones-lock-screen-on-ios-26-110535863.html\"><strong>New lock screen options</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"New Hold Assist being displayed at the wwdc keynote\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/a506ddc0-4556-11f0-9d7a-9a93e6a181c1\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-changes-coming-to-ipados-26\">New changes coming to iPadOS 26</h2>\n<p>Your iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.</p>\n<p><strong>Multitasking and real windowing:</strong> When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual update:</strong> Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.</p>\n<p><strong>New menu bar:</strong> When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.</p>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html\">first impressions of iPadOS 26</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-about-airpods\">What about AirPods?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ios-26-updates-for-airpods-preview-enhanced-audio-recording-camera-remote-and-more-173036046.html\">AirPods are also getting updated</a> with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced audio recording:</strong> Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Camera remote control:</strong> Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.</p>\n<p><strong>Live translation feature:</strong> While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html\">could be coming with iOS 26</a>. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-which-iphones-will-be-able-to-upgrade-to-ios-26\">Which iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>A few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS \u2014 iPhone XR, XS and XS Max \u2014 won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-is-releasing-ios-26-this-fall-heres-the-full-list-of-compatible-iphones-191854795.html\">eligible for the iOS 26 update</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>iPhone SE (second generation or later)</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 11</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 11 Pro</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 11 Pro Max</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 12</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 12 mini</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 12 Pro</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 12 Pro Max</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 13</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 13 mini</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 13 Pro</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 13 Pro Max</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 14</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 14 Plus</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 14 Pro</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 14 Pro Max</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 15</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 15 Plus</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 15 Pro</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 15 Pro Max</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 16</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 16 Plus</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 16 Pro</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 16 Pro Max</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone 16e</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not listed here are the presumed new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-max-and-air-everything-we-know-about-apples-new-phones-153024282.html\">iPhone 17 models</a> (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-install-ios-26-beta\">How to install iOS 26 beta</h2>\n<p>The iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/\">Apple Beta Software Program</a>.

The trailer itself doesn\u2019t give much away about the plot, but we do see the grave of Douglas Shetland, a close friend of Fisher who he was ordered to eliminate in fan favorite game entry, <em>Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</em>.</p>\n<p>Ubisoft is doing some interesting things in the adult animation space.

Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size. The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad. Other than that, it offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling.&nbsp;</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><em>Check out our coverage of the </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html\"><em>best Apple deals</em></a><em> for more discounts, and follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-macbook-air-m4-drops-to-a-record-low-price-123031057.html?src=rss"}

It allowed the company to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-says-it-can-resume-selling-key-ai-chips-to-china-120015817.html\">resume selling</a> the chip in China by July, reportedly after <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-may-give-us-government-a-cut-of-its-profits-to-sell-ai-chips-to-china-120003260.html\">closing a deal</a> that would give it 15 percent of the sales. But China didn't welcome the H20 with open arms. Local regulators instructed the biggest Chinese tech companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba to stop new orders for H20 chips, citing security concerns. The Cyberspace Administration of China talked to NVIDIA, claiming that AI experts had revealed that the chips could be tracked and controlled remotely. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang had admitted that Chinese regulators asked him about the supposed &quot;backdoor&quot; and said that he made it clear it didn't exist. &quot;Hopefully the response that we've given to the Chinese government will be sufficient,&quot; Huang said.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>A recent report by the <em>Financial Times</em>, however, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/china-reportedly-discouraged-purchase-of-nvidia-ai-chips-due-to-insulting-lutnick-statements-123055120.html\">claimed</a> that Chinese authorities didn't issue warnings against using NVIDIA chips just because of security concerns. Apparently, they found certain remarks by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick &quot;insulting.&quot; When the US allowed shipments of the H20 to China again, Lutnick said during an interview: &quot;We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best.

I\u2019m typically skeptical of the current generation of AI, but as I checked out the new software across various demo sessions, I found myself more and more intrigued. It seems like Google, along with Apple and Samsung, has been working on making these AI-powered updates more helpful in a way that might actually make our lives easier or simply more fun.</p>\n<p>There wasn\u2019t enough time to write up every single one of them, so I\u2019ve put a few of my favorites in this story to give you a better sense of what to expect when <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-series-hands-on-the-base-model-takes-center-stage-160040470.html\">the Pixel 10 series</a> hits retail shelves later this month. Spoiler alert: Many of these have to do with voice and calls \u2014 an area Google has historically excelled at.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2 id=\"jump-link-the-recorder-app-can-generate-backing-music\">The Recorder app can generate backing music</h2>\n<p>I have long been enamored with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-15-google-recorder-app-pixel-4.html\">Google\u2019s Recorder app</a>. It started with the on-device transcription that made getting quotes from my interviews easy and relatively secure. But when <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-voice-memos-app-is-getting-simple-multitrack-recording-184721503.html\">Apple introduced a multi-track recording function to its Voice Memos app</a>, I quickly jumped ship. While the iOS recorder has inferior transcription in terms of accuracy and readability, the fact that I could basically record a duet with myself seriously appealed to the musical theater geek in me. I played both Elphaba and Glinda, crooning their parts from \u201cFor Good\u201d into my iPhone.</p>\n<p>But when Google\u2019s senior director of product management for Pixel software Shenaz Zack told me the Pixel 10\u2019s recorder app would add AI-generated music to your singing, I went silent in slight disbelief. I spent much of my youth ripping karaoke tracks from YouTube videos, looking up \u201cminus one\u201d or \u201cbacking tracks\u201d or \u201cinstrumentals only\u201d on various download platforms. My friends and I were aspiring performers, looking to mix our own covers of popular songs, and a tool that would generate backing music to our voice tracks would have been a dream come true. Honestly it kind of still is.</p>\n<p>Zack walked me through the process twice \u2014 on my first try I sang a verse and part of the chorus of \u201cGolden\u201d from the <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em> soundtrack. I giggled self-consciously at the end, before Zack hit stop. As it recorded, the app actually showed a tag that indicated it knew I was singing, and when we selected the recording after, a chip appeared saying \u201cCreate and add music.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tapping that brought up a panel titled \u201cChoose a vibe to create music\u201d with two sections: Featured vibes and Your vibes. Under the first one, the options were \u201cChill beats,\u201d \u201cCozy,\u201d \u201cDance party,\u201d \u201cRainy day blues,\u201d \u201cRomantic\u201d and \u201cSurprise me.\u201d On my second attempt, when I rushed through a rendition of the all-time banger \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb,\u201d<em>&nbsp;</em>the app displayed a warning at the bottom that said \u201cThe beat might not match well if the recording is short.\u201d</p>\n<p>I chose Dance Party, hit next, and waited a minute or so while Recorder went to work. The animation at the top said the system was analyzing the audio, identifying the rhythm, locking onto the beat and harmonizing the track before delivering the result.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t quite know what I was expecting, but I can say that those who were at all concerned about digital rights management have nothing to worry about. The music that Google generated for \u201cGolden\u201d sounded nothing like the original, and while it did make my voice sound less lonely and made for a more complete track, I felt like I needed a few more adjustments to feel satisfied with it. As for \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb,\u201d the result was as generic as expected for an AI-generated soundtrack to a very basic nursery rhyme.</p>\n<p>To Google\u2019s credit, what came out seemed to be in the right key and rhythm, and I certainly will need much more time playing around with this to see if tweaking the settings will help. I also wanted to point out that the generated music also stopped as my singing stopped, so the giggling I mentioned earlier was not scored.</p>\n<p>Although this feature did not live up to my (admittedly unrealistic) fantasy, I do think it\u2019s a fun use of AI and seems harmless. It\u2019s not going to be a mainstay of most people\u2019s daily routines, although Zack did say that a large percent of people actually used Recorder for singing. This update could certainly make for a nice little dose of musical creativity.</p>\n<div id=\"15850c5260754a729bd0c71d619a6776\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"border: 0; margin: 1px; padding: 0; width: 99.375%;\"><div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNncZOfJs7Q/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div></div></div><div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div><div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\"> <div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal;\">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\"><div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;\"></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div> <div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent;\"></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: auto;\"> <div style=\"width: 0px; border-right: 8px solid transparent;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12px; width: 16px;\"></div> <div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-left: 8px solid transparent;\"></div></div></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div></div></a><p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNncZOfJs7Q/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Engadget (@engadget)</a></p></div></blockquote>\n</div> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-voice-translate-made-it-sound-like-i-was-speaking-german\">Voice Translate made it sound like I was speaking German</h2>\n<p>I had more concerns around the Voice Translate feature that was supposed to make you or your caller sound like you were speaking in a different language. According to Google, the goal is to \u201cbreak down language barriers during phone calls.\u201d When I asked Zack why the company felt the need to make the voice resemble the caller\u2019s, she said it was about personal connection.</p>\n<p>Zack explained that her parents live in India, and though they speak English, they\u2019re not very fluent. That makes for some difficulty when they call Zack\u2019s kids. Simply adding a robotic voice that\u2019s translating between the grandparents and the children wouldn\u2019t feel right, either. I was initially skeptical that fully replacing the caller\u2019s original voice with a translated version would help, but after a few demos, I am certainly swayed.</p>\n<p>To be clear, the person placing the call has to do so from a Pixel phone for Voice Translate to work. Once you choose Voice Translate from the Call Assist submenu, you\u2019ll have to choose a language. When the call is connected, the system will say to both parties that the \u201cCall is translated by Google AI in each speaker\u2019s voice. Audio is not saved.\u201d</p>\n<p>I tried this out a few times with a Google representative who spoke German, whom we will refer to as \u201cUncle Tim\u201d to make it easier for me to describe this demo. Each time he spoke, I could hear a couple seconds of his voice in German, before a chime played and the version in the original language became softer. What sounded like a dubbed actor playing Uncle Tim came on and conversed in English, complete with realistic replications of pitch, rhythm and expression.</p>\n<p>I also could hear feedback when I talked on the call, so I heard myself speaking German on the other end. It was truly strange, because it sort of did sound like me. One of my closest friends lives in Germany, and has had to put up with my attempts to learn German for more than 10 years. I immediately wanted to try Voice Translate on her to see if she would believe I had suddenly become fluent (but of course, I\u2019d have to figure out how to get her to ignore the warnings that Google AI was at work).</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll be honest, the experience wasn\u2019t perfect. Not only were the translations sometimes off (some of what Uncle Tim said in English didn\u2019t make sense), the generated voices seemed less like a complete replication of the caller and more like a novice dubbing artist. That\u2019s not a bad thing, since I was very concerned about impersonation being a problem.</p>\n<p>To that end, Zack said Google was deliberate about the implementation. She reminded me of the \u201cducking\u201d that was in place, which is when the original speech is still audible in the first few seconds and then softer throughout. Like the original audio is ducking below the dubbed voice \u2014 get it? And I remembered that while the AI voice might sound sort of like me, it isn\u2019t designed to simply make up things I\u2019m saying \u2014 it\u2019s just translating the content. I\u2019m the one that decides whether to go off and curse out a relative and have that conveyed in their native tongue, for example.</p>\n<p>Of course, there may still be bugs and quirks to work out. I was amused by the various accents that came through in the English-speaking version of Uncle Tim. At first he sounded American, but in subsequent conversations he took on an Australian accent.</p>\n<p>All this is powered by the Pixel 10\u2019s Tensor G5 chip and processed on-device using \u201ca new codec and semantic understanding,\u201d according to Zack, to understand the speaker\u2019s vocal expressions. For now, I see what Google is going for and cannot wait to call my friend in Frankfurt.</p>\n<p>At launch, Voice Translate will support translating to or from English with Spanish, German, Japanese, French, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian and Indonesian.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Kimmel is trying out the Magic Cue feature with help from Google's Tyler Kugler.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/645c4d90-7dec-11f0-bbf7-70ff8e2d4ad2\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Google/Screenshot by Engadget</div></figure>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-magic-cue-surfacing-your-flight-info-when-you-call-your-airline-is-helpful\">Magic Cue surfacing your flight info when you call your airline is helpful</h2>\n<p>The recorder app, translation and expressive-sounding AI are areas Google has long proven expertise in. And lest we forget, the company has also been a pioneer in suggesting actions from your emails and adding events to your calendar by scanning your inbox. With the Pixel 10\u2019s Magic Cue feature, Google is basically bringing this functionality to your texts and calls.</p>\n<p>While Magic Cue can helpfully show shortcuts within the Messages app to help you answer questions about reservations or send photos from recent trips, I\u2019m most into one specific aspect. When you call an airline to make changes to a flight, for instance, the Pixel 10 can pull up your reservation information and display it within the call, so you won\u2019t have to open your email, and search for the booking confirmation to have your reference number ready. Sure, it might only save you seconds, but it\u2019s so much easier, and Google already does a version of this in your inbox.</p>\n<p>I would love to see this particular feature expand and cover other types of appointments so you can quickly get codes or other identifying information during calls to, say, your plumber, doctor, insurance provider and more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-camera-and-photo-features-continue-to-improve\">Camera and photo features continue to improve</h2>\n<p>Google continues to improve upon areas it\u2019s led the way in, and photography remains a strength of Pixel phones. The company was one of the first major players to use its algorithmic prowess to dramatically improve the quality of low light photos and with the Pixel 10 Pro it again uses computational processing to deliver superior images.</p>\n<p>Pro Res Zoom on the new phone did manage to produce some surprisingly clean pictures of faraway buildings, at least in my demo at Google\u2019s Manhattan office. I was impressed by how clear the lines on the underside of a skyscraper that we zoomed to a 100x level on looked. Google was also careful to clarify that Pro Res Zoom won\u2019t work on people, and that distant text may look odd.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&quot;We've tuned Pro Res Zoom to minimize hallucinations, however they may still occur \u2014 especially with faraway text. Additionally, when Pro Res Zoom detects a person in the scene, we use a different enhancement algorithm that prevents inaccurate representations,&quot; according to Google.</p>\n<p>In those situations, the algorithm will drop to Super Res Zoom quality. Depending on which Pixel phone you\u2019re using, Super Res Zoom delivers up to either 20x or 30x zoom.</p>\n<p>In the results I saw, people standing on a deck at the top of a tower just seemed a bit pixelated compared to the building\u2019s facade, and the effect wasn\u2019t jarring or even really noticeable until I zoomed in. But that might be because they were a tiny part of the picture \u2014 I imagine things would look different if a person was the main subject in a scene.</p>\n<p>As someone who enjoys composing pictures, I didn\u2019t think the Camera Coach feature would do anything for me. But I was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked some of the AI\u2019s proposed framing options. I still don\u2019t think I\u2019ll use this much in the real world, but it might help other people who want tips on photography.</p>\n<div id=\"464aeb229fe14fc9b5f67943b00d5a54\"></div>\n<p>I was initially nonplussed about the new Photos feature that lets you tell the AI how to edit your pictures, but after a brief demo I came around. Simply telling Gemini to \u201cturn that red dress blue\u201d or \u201cget rid of the people in the background\u201d was not only easier, but suprrisingly effective. I also want to point out that Google also made tweaks to the Guided Frame feature in its camera app that helps those who are blind or visually impaired know what is in the scene. It now uses Gemini models, which should help with object recognition.</p>\n<p>Finally, it\u2019s worth calling out the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-pixel-10-phones-will-narc-on-ai-edited-images-161757203.html\">support for C2PA content authenticity initiative</a>. Google is building this into the Photos app, where metadata will show whether or not AI was used in a picture. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-pixel-10-phones-will-narc-on-ai-edited-images-161757203.html\">Pixel 10 phones will be the first to implement</a> the new industry-standard Content Credentials (CR) within its native camera app, and companies like Adobe, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI are all part of the initiative.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-an-assortment-of-other-updates-worthy-of-mention\">An assortment of other updates worthy of mention</h2>\n<p>Those were just a slice of the new AI-related features I was impressed by at my recent demos ahead of Google\u2019s event this week. But there are quite a few more I found promising, like visual overlays in Gemini Live and the new Pixel Journal app. I didn\u2019t spend as much time with either, but they worked in my brief demos. So did the \u201ctake a message\u201d feature that will send transcriptions of voicemails to you, which seems like a much better way to be alerted to a missed call than a hidden section of the Phone app.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not yet sold on the Daily Hub, which is basically an updated version of the existing pages that sit to the left of the home page showing relevant actions and articles you might want to explore. I\u2019m fairly intentional when it comes to looking for things to consume, and have specific apps I prefer for doomscrolling (Reddit over everything), so I\u2019m not sure Daily Hub will suit me.</p>\n<p>Still, the fact that I liked the bulk of the new AI features coming to the Pixel 10 series is pretty significant. Of course, I will still reserve judgement until I can spend more time with them in the real world, and hope to write reviews of some of them.

If we\u2019re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.'&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>However, TSMC may have noticed the Intel equity kerfuffle and executives reportedly held preliminary discussions about handing back subsidies if the US government asks to become a shareholder, according to the <em>WSJ</em>'s sources. TSMC was awarded $6.6 billion for its Arizona plant that started producing chips late last year for <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/apple-expects-to-source-over-19-billion-chips-from-u-s-factories-this-year\">Apple</a> and others. However, the company recently said it would invest another $100 billion over the next four years to build three more fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a major research and development center.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because of that extra investment, the Trump administration won't ask for a piece of TSMC or Micron (which also <a href=\"https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-and-trump-administration-announce-expanded-us-investments\">expanded its US facilities</a> in Idaho, New York and Virginia). &quot;The Commerce Department is not looking to take equity from TSMC and Micron,&quot; an unnamed official said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In any case, attempts by the US government to take equity in companies will likely face legal challenges due to language in the contracts. Companies are already required to share revenue with the US government if profits rise above a certain amount.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In another development, the US government may divert up to $2 billion in CHIPS Act funding toward critical minerals projects in the US, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-weighs-using-2-billion-chips-act-funding-critical-minerals-sources-say-2025-08-21/\"><em>Reuters</em></a> reported. The move aims to reduce US dependence on China for key minerals extensively used in the electronics and defense industries. &quot;The administration is creatively trying to find ways to fund the critical minerals sector,&quot; Reuters' source said, adding that those plans could change.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-administration-official-says-some-chips-act-companies-wont-need-to-give-up-equity-130041299.html?src=rss"}

But the base-model Kindle is also good, offering a cheap and easy entry point into ebooks. And Boox makes a few E Ink readers that do more than just display books. Now that most ereader companies also offer color models, the field is wider than ever. In short, there are a few things to consider before buying your next (or first) ereader and this guide covers product recommendations alongside advice on how to get the most out of your new device.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-the-best-ebook-readers-for-2025\">Best ereaders</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-ereader\">What to look for in an ereader</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-how-to-get-books-for-your-ereader\">How to get books for your ereader</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-how-we-test-ereaders\">How we test ereaders</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-ereader-faqs\">Ereader FAQs</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-best-ebook-readers-for-2025\">The best ebook readers for 2025</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-ereader\">What to look for in an ereader</h2> \n<p>Plenty of apps, including the Kindle app, will let you download and read digital books on an iPhone, Android Phone or tablet. But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. It manufactures electronic paper displays (EPD) composed of three sheets: one containing millions of microcapsules filled with black and white ink particles sandwiched between transparent electrode layers. When a charge is applied, either the black or white particles shift to the top, forming letters and the whitespace around them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Color ereaders add a <a href=\"https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Kaleido\">color filter array</a> on top of the standard black and white microcapsule layer. The result is two different resolutions on one screen \u2014 the color clarity is 150 dpi while black and white images and text are still 300 dpi.</p> \n<p>Because these displays are so different from standard backlight LED panels, you can expect most good ereaders to do a number of things well. They\u2019ll be easier to stare at for long periods of time and easier to read in direct sunlight. Also, since E Ink displays only require power to rearrange the ink, these devices have much longer battery lives than even the best tablets: we\u2019re talking weeks on a single charge, not days.</p> \n<p>The ereader market is not as saturated as, say, the smartphone market, but there are still plenty of options out there and they do have small but important differences among them. They tend to range from around $100 to more than $400, though usually the higher end options are stylus-enabled read/write <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html\">E Ink tablets</a> like the Kindle Scribe. Beyond price, you should consider physical properties like buttons, lights, storage and resolution, as well as how the software lets you find and access books.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-reading-features\"><strong>Reading features</strong></h3> \n<p>With any ereader, you\u2019ll navigate the OS via taps and swipes, and some add physical page-turn buttons. Most with built-in buttons have an auto-rotating screen so you can press with your right or left hand.</p> \n<p>As E Ink technology has advanced, resolution has greatly improved \u2013 even the budget Kindle ereader has a 300 ppi display. You can still find models with lower resolution, but we don\u2019t recommend them.</p> \n<p>Some ereaders have front LEDs that support light temperature adjustment. That means you can switch to a warmer light after the sun goes down, which will feel easier on the eyes. If you\u2019re concerned about blue light, you should go for a reader with that feature. Finally, dark mode is available on most later model ereaders, allowing you to invert the black and white text and background, which some people find easier to read in low-light settings.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-other-features\"><strong>Other features</strong></h3> \n<p>The capabilities of these pocket libraries have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/kindle-scribe-update-adds-new-brushes-and-better-organization-210011764.html\">advanced</a> considerably since the early days. In addition to storing books, some let you browse the web, run apps and play music. The screen\u2019s frame rate can\u2019t handle gaming, but it\u2019s good enough to show you the Wikipedia entry for Striver\u2019s Row while you read <em>Crook Manifesto</em>.</p> \n<p>If you listen to audiobooks, you may want a Bluetooth-enabled ereader capable of playing them. Most of the models we tested have that ability, with the notable exception of the Nook ereader we tried. Keep in mind that audiobook files can take up more space than print files so you'll probably want a device with a higher storage capacity if you plan on doing a lot of listening.</p> \n<p>Above all, you should consider where and how you intend to find books to read. Most ereaders make it easiest to shop through their own digital bookstores, but all of them (even <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-supports-epub-format-002501848.html\">Kindles</a>) will now let you download titles from other sources, like libraries, unaffiliated ebook sellers and free public domain sites.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"An assortment of ereaders, including ones from Kobo, Kindle, Boox, Nook and PocketBook are arranged on a tan bamboo desk with a white keyboard and black mouse in the background. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/c06d4490-cf16-11ed-96e7-3cba2c2f1226\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-get-books-for-your-ereader\">How to get books for your ereader</h2> \n<p>Kindle, Nook and Kobo all have their own stores that you access directly from each brand\u2019s devices.

It also syncs your reading across devices and apps, so you can pick up where you left off on your phone if you forgot your ereader at home. It truly is the most convenient way to go, but if you don\u2019t want to be locked into one brand\u2019s store, or if you opt for an ereader without its own marketplace, you do have options.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-to-upload-epubs-onto-an-ereader\"><strong>How to upload ePubs onto an ereader</strong></h3> \n<p>Stores like <a href=\"https://www.ebooks.com/en-us/\">ebooks.com</a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Google+Play&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9ib29rcz9obD1lbl9VUyZnbD1VUyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTFkY2NiY2QtYWM2NS00ZmMwLTk5ZDMtNmQ5Y2QzODlhY2IxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9ib29rcz9obD1lbl9VUyZnbD1VUyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASZY0gT_fKMpYAx96_pPEUaXBkxUdcX2GsuN5W5Q3ANH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fbooks%3Fhl%3Den_US%26gl%3DUS\">Google Play</a> have millions of ebooks for sale as digital rights-managed (DRM) ePub files, which Kobo, Nook and PocketBook readers can read in their native ereader apps. Kindles don\u2019t support DRM ePub files at all and Boox devices require third party reading apps (of which there are many) to read those files. Titles from Apple Books are only readable in iOS devices.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Titles from some publishers like <a href=\"https://www.ebooks.com/en-us/publisher/tor-publishing-group/207044153?_c=1\">Tor</a> and public domain classics from sites like <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/\">Project Gutenberg</a> are also sold as ePubs, but without the added DRM. Consequently, Kindles and the Boox Neoreader <em>do</em> support those files. Books you get from third-party sources will look just like ones you bought from a proprietary store, thanks to the flowable, formatted nature of ePub files. While these device-agnostic ebook collections give you extra options for finding your next read, they require a few additional steps to get the files onto your ereader.</p> \n<p>To do so, you\u2019ll typically need a computer running a free program called <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=73e6d253-5a10-4f58-b539-815233e32f36&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Adobe&amp;linkText=Adobe+Digital+Editions&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZG9iZS5jb20vc29sdXRpb25zL2Vib29rL2RpZ2l0YWwtZWRpdGlvbnMvZG93bmxvYWQuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTFkY2NiY2QtYWM2NS00ZmMwLTk5ZDMtNmQ5Y2QzODlhY2IxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZG9iZS5jb20vc29sdXRpb25zL2Vib29rL2RpZ2l0YWwtZWRpdGlvbnMvZG93bmxvYWQuaHRtbCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZHqqiiAxW0zph0RbXm7OdiW_5kDVWfy8mgD2jdFYezz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fsolutions%2Febook%2Fdigital-editions%2Fdownload.html\">Adobe Digital Editions</a> (ADE). After buying and downloading the ePub file, open ADE and plug your ereader into your computer (all readers here have a USB-C port for charging and data transfers). Your device should pop up in the left panel. Drag and drop the ePub file from your downloads folder into the main panel in ADE. The file will display as an image of the book cover. Drag that image onto your device on the left panel. If the file includes digital rights management (which protects against unauthorized copying) you\u2019ll need to authorize your ereader, which requires using or creating a free <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Adobe+ID&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2hlbHB4LmFkb2JlLmNvbS9tYW5hZ2UtYWNjb3VudC91c2luZy9jcmVhdGUtdXBkYXRlLWFkb2JlLWlkLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWxweC5hZG9iZS5jb20vbWFuYWdlLWFjY291bnQvdXNpbmcvY3JlYXRlLXVwZGF0ZS1hZG9iZS1pZC5odG1sIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAe1FmisAa8XGIvkkTl5PDnkcDwNZclFfu47-GV95Mtev&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fhelpx.adobe.com%2Fmanage-account%2Fusing%2Fcreate-update-adobe-id.html\">Adobe ID</a>.

As long as you\u2019re signed into Amazon, this wirelessly transfers the files to your associated device.</p> \n<p>Boox also uses a browser uploader called <a href=\"https://push.boox.com/#/push/file\">BooxDrop</a> (along with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKZ0_NBysfk\">many other methods</a>) to deliver ePubs to the device. Open it from the Boox App menu and you\u2019ll see a device-specific url. Type that into your browser to access a file delivery portal that uploads to your library. Boox\u2019s built-in ereader app, NeoReader, also doesn\u2019t support files with DRM, so you won\u2019t be able to read current titles from most publishers using that app. Fortunately, Boox devices run nearly every ereader app out there, Kobo and Kindle included, letting you access ePubs any number of ways.</p> \n<p>Recently, Bookshop.org, the online seller of physical books that supports indie bookstores, started selling ebooks and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/bookshoporg-is-now-selling-ebooks-113033975.html\">up to 100 percent of the profits</a> will go to local booksellers. The company uses a different rights management system than ADE so, right now, you can only read titles you buy from them on the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9db8d14c-9935-42a7-8088-54e01b60ae32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Bookshop&amp;linkText=Bookshop.org+app&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vYm9va3Nob3Aub3JnLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTFkY2NiY2QtYWM2NS00ZmMwLTk5ZDMtNmQ5Y2QzODlhY2IxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vYm9va3Nob3Aub3JnLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVxd4CluVkpVSZt20v3DXVyWURt8UxcMVrQMGnBgx7G0&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2F\">Bookshop.org app</a>, but the company is working with the makers of both Kindle and Kobo to extend compatibility to those ereaders.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-to-read-library-books-on-an-ereader\"><strong>How to read library books on an ereader</strong></h3> \n<p>Your local library card lets you borrow audio and ebooks through a program called <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/e-book-library-app-overdrive-is-shutting-down-on-may-1st-194807737.html\">Overdrive</a> and its companion app <a href=\"https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby\">Libby</a>. On a <a href=\"https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017677053-Borrow-eBooks-from-the-public-library-using-your-Kobo-eReader\">Kobo</a>, you have have built-in access to Overdrive in a separate tab. Once you\u2019ve linked your public library card, the search function will include results for titles available from your local library system; a few taps will upload your selections to your device for the length of the loan. I personally find it easiest to borrow the title I want through the Libby app on my phone. After that, the book pops up on my Kobo\u2019s home screen once the device syncs.</p> \n<p>To read library books on a <a href=\"https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0431.html\">Kindle</a>, you can either go through the Libby app or the Overdrive section of your library\u2019s website. Once you click Borrow, you\u2019ll see the option to \u201cRead now with Kindle,\u201d which takes you to Amazon\u2019s site to sign in. After that, the book will be delivered to your device the next time it connects to WiFi.</p> \n<p>For other ereaders, you\u2019ll go through your library\u2019s Overdrive portal and download the ePub after clicking the Borrow button. You can then use the ADE process we described above. Devices that run external apps, like Boox's Page, Go Color 7 or Palma, allow you to read library books via the Libby app, just as you would on a smartphone or iPad.</p> \n<p>You can also use the Libby app to borrow audiobooks, but you won\u2019t be able to access them through your ereader. (The exception is an ereader, like a Boox device, that allows external apps). I found it was easier to listen to an audiobook on my phone anyway, regardless of whether I borrowed it through Libby or bought it from Kindle or Kobo.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"Four ereaders are arranged on a dark brown wooden table outside. There are Boox, Kindle and Kobo devices showing the covers of different novels from Tana French, F.

We look at what\u2019s available, what\u2019s new, and what shoppers and professional reviewers have to say. Then we narrow a list to the best candidates for hands-on testing.</p> \n<p>Over the course of the past two years, I\u2019ve tested just over a dozen ereaders, representing five different brands: Amazon, Kobo, Barnes &amp; Noble, Boox and PocketBook. I bought, borrowed and uploaded books for each device using the methods above. I used each one for between a few days to a few months. I evaluated each one in the areas of book access, ease of reading, extra features and overall value. Here\u2019s everything we tested so far:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\"

href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-colorsoft-review-the-missing-link-in-amazons-ereader-lineup-131529685.html\">Amazon\u2019s first color Kindle</a> impressed with its quick page-turns and load times, auto-adjusting front light and, of course, a decently striking color E Ink display. But at $280, it\u2019s more expensive than all of the other color ereaders in its size range, including the Kobo Libra Colour and the Boox Go Color 7.</p> \n<p>Also, some Colorsoft owners reported seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader\u2019s display. This issue did not affect our first review unit during the original testing period, but it eventually appeared. An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget: \"A small number of customers have reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display. We take the quality of our products seriously\u2014customers who notice this can reach out to our customer service team for a replacement or refund, and we\u2019re making the appropriate adjustments to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward.\"</p> \n<p>Amazon sent us a new Colorsoft ereader at the end of 2024 and it does appear that the fixes the company made resolved the yellow-band issue. The screen on our second review unit appears warmer overall, but not overly so. It\u2019s more akin to the screen on the Kobo Libra Colour, and that\u2019s a good thing.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-boox-go-7-stylus-enabled-ereader\"><strong>Boox Go 7 stylus-enabled ereader</strong></h3> \n<p>Boox recently released two new stylus-enabled generations of their seven-inch reader: The monochrome <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Go+7+and+a+color-screen+Go+Color+7+%28Gen+II%29&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3AuYm9veC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvZ283Izp-OnRleHQ9V2F0Y2glMjB0aGUlMjB2aWRlby0sVHdvJTIwRGlzcGxheXMsLSUyQyUyMFR3byUyMEtpbmRzJTIwb2YiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zaG9wLmJvb3guY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2dvNyM6fjp0ZXh0PVdhdGNoJTIwdGhlJTIwdmlkZW8tLFR3byUyMERpc3BsYXlzLC0lMkMlMjBUd28lMjBLaW5kcyUyMG9mIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXIxxfcPkPJsAEPeG0oasL5MvRqW6YMGj0xd6E0erdjb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Fgo7%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DWatch%2520the%2520video-%2CTwo%2520Displays%2C-%252C%2520Two%2520Kinds%2520of\">Go 7 and a color-screen Go Color 7 (Gen II)</a>. After trying out the stylus-enabled Go 7, I still like the standard, non-stylus enabled version better. True, I liked the Notebook app with its array of handwriting templates and I appreciated the low-to-no latency with the stylus. It also offers a good assortment of brush, pen and style options. But outside of the Notebook app, I didn\u2019t find much use for the stylus.</p> \n<p>I was able to doodle in the margins of DRM-free books in Boox\u2019s native NeoReader, but it doesn\u2019t work in other apps or on any rights-managed books. There's a FreeMark option that allows you to draw or write atop any app, but it saves your doodles as separate images, as opposed to allowing you to mark up the page itself. I also found enabling the stylus to be a little glitchy. If you plan to do a lot of writing, you\u2019ll probably be <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html\">better served by an E Ink tablet</a>, but if you want an ereader that can mark up your books, I suggest going with the Kobo Libra Color, detailed above.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-ereader-faqs\">Ereader FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-an-ereader-and-an-e-ink-reader\"><strong>What's the difference between an ereader and an e-ink reader?</strong></h3> \n<p>Really, they are the same thing. <a href=\"https://www.eink.com/about?company\">E Ink</a> is a company that designs and manufactures the paper-like screens found in most ereader devices. Technically, anything you read ebooks on can act as an ereader, so your phone, iPad or Android tablet could all serve that purpose, but they\u2019re not considered dedicated ereaders. While there are some devices marketed as ereaders that have LCD or OLED screens instead of E Ink, they aren\u2019t as common. One of the benefits of ereaders is the E Ink screen\u2019s paper-like quality, which causes less eye strain for many people.</p> \n<p>But there is a difference between ereaders and E Ink <em>tablets</em>. These larger e-ink devices also employ E Ink screens, but they have stylus input and are often used for note taking and other tasks in addition to reading ebooks. We have an entire guide devoted to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html\">helping you pick out an E Ink tablet</a>.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-are-there-ads-on-my-ereader\"><strong>Are there ads on my ereader?</strong></h3> \n<p>The base model Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite come with ads by default, but you can opt to pay $20 to remove them, either at the time of purchase or after you start using the device. The ads are limited to the lockscreen and are typically for other books or Kindle services. Kobo and Boox ereaders don\u2019t come with ads.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-which-ereader-has-the-longest-battery-life\"><strong>Which ereader has the longest battery life?</strong></h3> \n<p>Of the devices we tested, the Boox Go Color 7 has the largest listed battery capacity at 2,300mAh (Amazon doesn\u2019t list the capacity of its Kindle devices). But thanks to the nature of E Ink screens and the relatively limited processing power required to display e-books, nearly all ereaders can go for weeks before they need a recharge. That means battery life probably isn\u2019t as much of a deciding factor in buying an ereader as it would be with a tablet or smartphone.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-which-ereaders-can-read-kindle-books\"><strong>Which ereaders can read Kindle books?</strong></h3> \n<p>Amazon\u2019s Kindle ereaders are the obvious answer, but other devices capable of running apps can also read titles from the Kindle store. For example, you can download the Kindle app on a Boox ereader through Google Play (the store comes standard in the Boox app menu). You can then sign into your Kindle account and access all the books in your library \u2014 the same way you\u2019d read Kindle books on your phone or tablet.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-can-you-buy-kindle-books-without-a-kindle\"><strong>Can you buy Kindle books without a Kindle?</strong></h3> \n<p>Yes. You can buy Kindle books through the Kindle app or through Amazon\u2019s website via a browser. You can read those titles on a Kindle or any device that can run the Kindle app, such as a smartphone, tablet or computer. Just be aware that Kindle titles can <em>only</em> be read through one of Amazon\u2019s ereaders or the Kindle app. The company uses proprietary digital rights management on all ebooks it sells that can\u2019t be read by other ereader apps like Kobo or Adobe ADE.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-kindle-and-kobo\"><strong>What's the difference between Kindle and Kobo?</strong></h3> \n<p>Both Kindle and Kobo are brands of dedicated ereaders that support searching, buying, downloading and reading ebooks from their own stores. Both also support borrowing books from your local library via Overdrive and Libby.</p> \n<p>The difference is that Kindle is owned by Amazon and uses the Kindle store, whereas Kobo is owned by Rakuten and its books come from the Kobo store. Both stores come pre-loaded as a tab on their respective ereader and both carry most in-print books. Each store also carries their own exclusive ebooks as well, but Amazon\u2019s library of <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Kindle-only+books&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2I_bm9kZT0xOTI3MTcwNjAxMSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MWRjY2JjZC1hYzY1LTRmYzAtOTlkMy02ZDljZDM4OWFjYjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vYj9ub2RlPTE5MjcxNzA2MDExIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVfQtILpNl4j-jhmpgChMRVcssUkpbLilOSDy4FrIhd1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fb%3Fnode%3D19271706011\">Kindle-only books</a> is much larger <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=10b363e1-6abb-4fc0-b019-cb4ff191d49a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Kobo&amp;linkText=than+Kobo%E2%80%99s&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb2JvLmNvbS91cy9lbi9wL2tvYm9vcmlnaW5hbHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua29iby5jb20vdXMvZW4vcC9rb2Jvb3JpZ2luYWxzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATjuNnZvRXlMJC6dkHZ86gdxoVLQ4PXMnCI_YfD7Ivq4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fkobooriginals\">than Kobo\u2019s</a>.

Other ereaders, like Boox, let you borrow books after downloading the Libby App. Only Kobo ereaders let you search for and borrow books directly on the ereader, with a dedicated Overdrive tab. Kindles, on the other hand, utilize a convenient \u201cread on Kindle\u201d function from the Libby app or website. You can send a borrowed book to your Kindle just by signing into your account. Both methods are pretty easy, so which is the best for you probably depends on other factors than just the library-book feature.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</h2> \n<p><strong>August 2025</strong>: Included new frequently asked questions covering battery life, E Ink screens and ads on ereaders.

Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>For gamers, there are also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-headset-130006477.html\">gaming headsets</a> that feature noise cancellation \u2014 some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we\u2019re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort.</p> \n<p>Many headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you\u2019ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you\u2019re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste.</p> \n<p>Finally, if you\u2019re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it\u2019s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-type-of-noise-cancellation\">Type of noise cancellation</h3> \n<p>Next, you\u2019ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You\u2019ll come across terms like \u201chybrid active noise cancellation\u201d or \u201chybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,\u201d and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside <em>and </em>on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than \u201cregular\u201d ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn\u2019t change.</p> \n<p>Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I\u2019m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-customization\">Customization</h3> \n<p>You\u2019ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master &amp; Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-noise-canceling-headphones\">How we test noise-canceling headphones</h2> \n<p>The primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don\u2019t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/\">podcasts</a>, while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls.</p> \n<p>Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I\u2019ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.</p> \n<p>To test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can\u2019t hop on a flight, I\u2019ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones.</p> \n<p>ANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I\u2019m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I\u2019ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-noise-canceling-headphones-we-tested\">Other noise-canceling headphones we tested</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-airpods-max\">AirPods Max</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326-143034684.html\">Apple\u2019s AirPods Max</a> are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-dyson-on-trac\">Dyson On-Trac</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/dyson-ontrac-headphones-review-when-the-basics-arent-enough-151518312.html\">On-Trac headphones</a> have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that\u2019s what\u2019s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren\u2019t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that\u2019s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sonos-ace\">Sonos Ace</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sonos-ace-headphones-review-an-impressive-but-incomplete-debut-130040041.html\">Sonos Ace</a> is an excellent debut for the company\u2019s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sony-ult-wear\">Sony ULT Wear</h3> \n<p>If most headphones don\u2019t have the level of bass you desire, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-ult-wear-headphones-review-brain-shaking-bass-160000739.html\">ULT Wear</a> is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn\u2019t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-beats-studio-pro\">Beats Studio Pro</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-pro-review-upgraded-sound-makes-all-the-difference-140058369.html\">Studio Pro</a> lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they\u2019re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-master--dynamic-mh40-2nd-gen\">Master &amp; Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen)</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mh40-wireless-2nd-gen-review-133022239.html\">MH40</a> are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn\u2019t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company\u2019s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-bowers--wilkins-px8\">Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px8</h3> \n<p>The company\u2019s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-review-183002357.html\">Px8</a> is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-noble-audio-fokus-apollo\">Noble Audio FoKus Apollo</h3> \n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html\">this</a> is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html\">best wireless headphones</a>, the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers &amp; Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-noise-canceling-headphones-faqs\">Noise-canceling headphones FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-does-noise-cancellation-block-all-noise\">Does noise cancellation block all noise?</h3> \n<p>Noise cancellation doesn\u2019t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-is-there-a-difference-between-wired-vs-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones\">Is there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones?</h3> \n<p>In terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones \u2014 one wired and one wireless \u2014 with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-does-noise-cancellation-impact-sound-quality\">Does noise cancellation impact sound quality?</h3> \n<p>ANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn\u2019t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss"}

Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Polls feature:</strong> Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls.

But now a new challenger has arrived: The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-pixel-10-pro-fold-offers-improved-dust-resistance-and-qi2-wireless-charging-160052381.html\">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>. The full details are now available in the wake of Google's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-10-event-live-updates-from-the-hardware-launch-today-including-gemini-pixel-watch-and-more-110013185.html\">splashy launch event</a>, which debuted the Fold alongside the full new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-series-hands-on-the-base-model-takes-center-stage-160040470.html\">Pixel 10</a> line, a new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/the-pixel-watch-4-offers-better-battery-life-and-easier-screen-replacements-160053246.html\">Pixel smartwatch</a> and two new earbuds, too (see <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/everything-announced-at-the-made-by-google-pixel-event-including-the-pixel-10-lineup-161155567.html\">everything Google announced</a>). But the Pixel 10 Pro Fold was the star of the show, and it's vying with the Z Fold 7 for the title of best foldable \u2014 both offer very similar designs, but each bringing something unique to the table.</p>\n<p>Samsung launched its first foldable phone in 2019, so it's had quite a bit of time to refine the Galaxy Fold over the years. Google on the other hand just released its first Pixel Fold a couple years ago \u2014 but has already largely <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/pixel-9-pro-fold-one-year-later-how-google-caught-up-to-samsung-in-just-two-generations-130008722.html\">evened the match</a>.

You can also check out our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-how-the-best-foldables-stack-up-173027127.html\">comparison of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Galaxy Fold 6</a> to see how much has changed in a year.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-price\">Price</h2>\n<p>First things first, how much will one of these high-tech folding phones cost you? That is the make-or-break question, after all. The newest Pixel foldable is still less expensive than this year's Z Fold: it starts at $1,799 while the Galaxy smartphone starts at $2,000.</p>\n<p>You don't have any other real choices for &quot;book-style&quot; foldables in the US market. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-open-review-a-thinner-and-more-affordable-flagship-foldable-specs-price-150031633.html\">OnePlus Open</a> can be had for $1,499, but it's almost two years old. And Apple's most expensive phone is currently the $1,599 1TB iPhone 16 Pro Max \u2014 but as a non-foldable model with just a single screen, it's hardly a straight comparison. If the rumor mill is to be believed, Apple may finally bow a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-has-reportedly-made-foldable-iphone-prototypes-152804263.html\">foldable iPhone in 2026</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-dimensions-and-display\">Dimensions and display</h2>\n<p>It's a race for the largest display and Samsung won this time \u2014 but not by much. The Galaxy Z Fold is just a hair bigger than the Pixel Pro Fold. Both phones' inner displays are 8 inches across when fully opened, while Samsung comes out ahead on the outer display with 6.5 inches (the Pixel is 6.4 inches).</p>\n<p>As for height, the new foldable Pixel phone is 6.1 inches and the Galaxy Z is 6.2 inches \u2014 not a huge difference there. When unfolded, the Samsung wins on size efficiency, packing the identically sized 8-inch internal display into an area that's 0.3 inches smaller \u2014 5.6 inches versus the Pixel's 5.9.</p>\n<p>This year, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold\u2019s displays have been upgraded to a Super Actua Flex OLED display with ultra-thin glass. Both the front screen and back cover come equipped with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2.</p>\n<p>As for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it has a Dynamic AMOLED display (inner and outer) and comes with the Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on the front and the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the backside. The glass is ultra-thin, yet it's 50 percent thicker than before.</p>\n<p>While slightly bigger, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is still lighter than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The Samsung model weighs only 7.6 ounces \u2014 down nearly an ounce from its 2024 model \u2014 while its Google competition comes in at 9.1 ounces (the same as last year's model).</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (left) next to the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold (right)\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/942578d0-7de2-11f0-bd3f-8dc3bc88d36a\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (left) compared to the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold (right).

(Sam also has first impressions of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on-forget-thinness-google-is-going-hard-on-durability-160018609.html\">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, but speed tests will happen a bit later.)</p>\n<p>Both phones offer the choice of 256GB, 512GB or 1TB storage. On the RAM front, the Pixel Fold delivers 16GB across the line, while the Samsung model reserves that level for the top 1TB storage tier; the small models get 12GB instead. The Galaxy phone will cost you $2,419 if you decide you need the maximum amount of storage, whereas the Pixel Fold tops out at $2,149.</p>\n<p>When it comes to battery life, Samsung's foldable lasts up to 24 hours with a 4,400mAh battery. The Pixel lasts up to 30 hours thanks to a more capacious 5,015mAh battery rating. Furthermore, the Pixel Fold is certified for Qi2 wireless charging, which Google is branding as &quot;<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/pixelsnap-is-googles-qi2-powered-answer-to-magsafe-for-the-pixel-10-series-160048306.html\">Pixelsnap</a>&quot; across its 2025 Pixel line for the first time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-cameras\">Cameras</h2>\n<p>For many shoppers, a phone is only as good as its cameras, and both of these phones bring a strong lens game. Each has three rear cameras, though they're different aesthetically. You'll notice the Pixel has a larger camera bump with two rows, while the Galaxy has a thinner vertical line of cameras.</p>\n<p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold's rear camera array consists of a 48MP wide sensor, a 10.5MP ultrawide and a 10.8MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom. All three offer &quot;Super Res Zoom&quot; up to 20x with optical and electronic image stabilization. Per our own Sam Rutherford, the potential drawback here is that Google played it safe: &quot;The biggest potential shortcoming of the P10PF is that its camera hardware is largely staying the same. Granted, that's not a huge deal because the previous model had the best photo quality of any foldable phone.&quot;</p>\n<p>By comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 rear camera trio includes the same 200MP wide-angle camera as the company's Galaxy S25 Ultra, but carries over the 12MP ultrawide and 10MP telephone from the Z Fold 6. Zoom levels are 3x optical and 30x digital.</p>\n<p>While we have yet to put the Pixel 10 Pro Fold cameras through their paces, Sam was still liking <em>last year's</em> Pixel Fold versus the Galaxy Z Fold 7 when he reviewed the latter: &quot;At night, the Fold 7's shots remained surprisingly sharp. I still prefer the Pixel 9 Pro Fold due to its more accurate white balance and often sharper focus, though Samsung's phone isn't far behind.&quot; And the entire Pixel line's cameras are (of course) supercharged with some new Google Gemini AI niceties, like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/googles-pixel-10-camera-coach-uses-ai-to-help-you-take-the-best-photos-160032157.html\">Camera Coach feature</a> that enables voice-controlled photo editing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both the Pixel and Galaxy offer similar 10MP specs on their front and inner selfie cameras.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-color-options\">Color options</h2>\n<p>If you like having multiple colors to choose from, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is winning in this category. It comes in Mint, Jetblack, Blue Shadow and Silver Shadow. Mint is only available if you buy your phone online \u2014 you won't be seeing that one in stores.</p>\n<p>As for the Pixel 10 Fold Pro, your options are Moonstone and Jade.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-full-specs-comparison\">Full specs comparison</h2>\n<table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p><strong>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</strong></p>\n</td><td><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</strong></p>\n</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Starting price</strong></p>\n</td><td><p>$1,799</p>\n</td><td><p>$2,000</p>\n</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Dimensions</strong></p>\n</td><td><p>Folded: 6.1 x 3.0 x 0.4 inches (155.2 x 76.3 x 10.8mm)<br />Unfolded: 6.1 x 5.9 x 0.2 inches (155.2 x 150.4 x 5.2mm)</p>\n</td><td><p>Folded: 6.2 x 2.9 x 0.4 inches (158.4 x 72.8 x 8.9mm)<br />Unfolded: 6.2 x 5.6 x 0.2 inches (158.4 x 143.2 x 4.2mm)</p>\n</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Weight</strong></p>\n</td><td><p>9.1 oz (258g)</p>\n</td><td><p>7.6 oz (215g)</p>\n</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Processor</strong></p>\n</td><td><p>Tensor G5</p>\n</td><td><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy (3nm)</p>\n</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Display</strong></p>\n</td><td><p>Inner: 8-inch Super Actua<br />Outer: 6.4-inch Actua</p>\n</td><td><p>Inner: 8-inch Dynamic AMOLED<br />Outer: 6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED</p>\n</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Storage</strong></p>\n</td><td><p>256GB / 512GB / 1TB</p>\n</td><td><p>256GB / 512GB / 1TB</p>\n</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>RAM</strong></p>\n</td><td><p>16GB</p>\n</td><td><p>12GB (for 256GB, 512GB configs) | 16GB (for 1TB config)</p>\n</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Battery</strong></p>\n</td><td><p>5,015mAh | &quot;Up to 30 hours&quot;</p>\n</td><td><p>4,400mAh | &quot;Up to 24 hours&quot;</p>\n</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Camera</strong></p>\n</td><td><p>Main: 48MP wide (F1.7) | 10.5MP Ultrawide (F2.2) | 10.8MP Telephoto lens (F3.1) with 5x optical | Super Res Zoom up to 20x<br />Front: 10MP (F2.2)<br />Inner: 10 MP (F2.2)</p>\n</td><td><p>Main: 200MP Wide (F1.7) | 12MP Ultrawide (F2.2) | 10 MP (F2.4) Telephoto (F2.4) with 3x optical zoom<br />Front: 10MP (F2.2)<br />Inner: 10MP (F2.2)</p>\n</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Stylus support</strong></p>\n</td><td><p>No</p>\n</td><td><p>No</p>\n</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Colors</strong></p>\n</td><td><p>Moonstone, Jade</p>\n</td><td><p>Mint (online only), Jetblack, Blue Shadow, Silver Shadow</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Updated August 21, 2:26PM ET:</strong> Added a section comparing the cameras on both phones.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-how-the-newest-foldable-phones-stack-up-165018793.html?src=rss"}

So let's keep the mood at &quot;cautiously optimistic.&quot; Just in case.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-out-on-september-4-143856097.html?src=rss"}

The XM5s are supremely comfortable, thanks to a slim cushioned headband and soft earcups. In our review, we had no problem wearing them for hours at a time and never felt uncomfortable pressure on the ears or head.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>30mm carbon-fiber drivers deliver excellent audio, delivering a wide and immersive soundstage. The XM5 carries eight total microphones as part of its active noise-canceling system, up from four on the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm4-headphones-review-150050779-150054752.html\"><ins>previous model</ins></a>, and delivers top-of-class ANC.</p> \n<p>The battery life on these headphones is best in class, with around 30 hours of listening per charge. Touch controls on the outside panel of the right ear cup help you control your music with ease, allowing you to play, pause, skip tracks and adjust the volume right from the headphones. The only real downside at this point is you\u2019re buying a pair of headphones that are three years old; the XM6 offers some noteworthy improvements. But, of course, it\u2019ll cost you.</p> \n<p>If you've been thinking about upgrading your headphones, or picking up your first pair of real high-quality cans, then take advantage of these savings. The sale price of $274 applies to the black model only, though the other colors are 18 percent off, selling for $328.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/sonys-wh-1000xm5-headphones-are-32-percent-off-ahead-of-labor-day-143447083.html?src=rss"}

The company says this will allow customers to tailor the immersion to their preferences or to the content they're watching.

It's actually cheaper than the official Switch 2 camera with this sale and it looks a whole lot cooler. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise.

The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console.</p> \n<p>There's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p.

After a court <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-infringed-masimo-pulse-oximeter-patent-103726704.html\">sided with Masimo</a> in 2023, Apple was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-watch-ban-is-here-why-apple-is-no-longer-selling-the-watch-series-9-and-watch-ultra-203706971.html\">forced to stop selling</a> the Watch Series 9 and the Ultra 2 in the US for a few weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In order to circumvent the import ban for the devices, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-will-remove-blood-oxygen-app-from-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-to-evade-us-import-ban-194517839.html\">Apple removed</a> the Blood Oxygen app for the watch models sold in the US.

It argued that the agency typically requires both sides to be heard before making such decisions and that Customs &quot;exceeded its authority.&quot; Masimo is now asking the court to put an injunction on UCBP's decision and, ultimately, to only allow imports of the devices if their blood oxygen-tracking function is disabled.</p>\n<p>&quot;Each passing day that this unlawful ruling remains in effect irreparably deprives Masimo of its right to be free from unfair trade practices and to preserve its competitive standing in the US marketplace,&quot; Masimo said.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/masimo-files-lawsuit-over-apples-redesigned-blood-oxygen-monitoring-feature-130054895.html?src=rss"}

The Insta360 GO Ultra is being billed as a new, more powerful product line in the GO series, instead of a replacement for the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/insta360s-go-3s-is-its-new-tiny-wearable-camera-with-4k-video-130044121.html\">GO 3S</a>.</p>\n<p>This next generation represents a substantial step up in performance, powered by a new 5nm AI chip, which is a big jump from the 14nm chip found on the GO 3S. It also benefits from a larger 1/1.28-inch sensor, roughly twice the size of the one in the 3S. All of this unlocks better image quality with support for HDR, 4K capture at 60 fps and double the frame rate of the 3S. The Ultra also offers PureVideo, an enhancement that uses AI-powered algorithms to reduce noise and increase brightness in low-light captures.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The form factor for the Ultra is largely the same as the 3S, with a compact camera body that can be optionally housed in an Action Pod that offers additional battery life and a 2.5-inch flip touchscreen for live camera view. The Ultra weighs 53 grams (around 1.9 ounces), 14 grams more than the 3S, and sports a square body, as opposed to the pill-like shape of the 3S.</p>\n<p>The slightly larger body means a 70-minute standalone battery life, which is just over 80 percent more than the 38 minutes on the 3S. The Action Pod extends this to 200 minutes. The Ultra also offers removable storage, expandable up to 2TB.</p>\n<p>Like most <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-x5-launch-date-price-hands-on-132439941.html\">Insta360 cameras</a>, much of the design is geared toward action shots for the more adventurous among us. The GO Ultra's IPX8 rating means it's waterproof down to 33 feet underwater. A magnetic clip system makes it easy to attach the GO Ultra to a piece of clothing or equipment and start capturing your adventure in 4K.</p>\n<p>The Insta360 GO Ultra is available now worldwide for $450.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-launches-new-action-camera-with-removable-storage-130019177.html?src=rss"}

When the US government <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-says-it-can-resume-selling-key-ai-chips-to-china-120015817.html\">reversed its decision</a> in July and allowed the company to start shipping its chips to China, Lutnick told <em>CNBC</em>: &quot;We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best. The fourth one down, we want to keep China using it... The idea is the Chinese are more than capable of building their own. You want to keep one step ahead of what they can build, so they keep buying our chips. You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack. That's the thinking.&quot; To note, a previous <em>Times</em> report stated that the government allowed NVIDIA to ship its products to China again after agreeing to hand over 15 percent of its profits.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>As a response to Lutnick's remarks, the <em>Times</em> says Chinese authorities sought ways to prevent local companies from buying H20 chips. CAC issued an informal notice instructing China's biggest tech firms, such as ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop new orders for H20 chips until the government is done conducting a national security review. The companies are compelled to comply, because they could face substantial fines from the CAC if they don't. Meanwhile, NDRC also issued an informal notice, asking local tech companies not to purchase any NVIDIA chip.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Reuters</em> recently reported that NVIDIA is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-is-reportedly-developing-an-ai-chip-for-china-more-powerful-than-the-h20-130057520.html\">developing a new chip</a> for the Chinese market that's more powerful than the H20, perhaps driven in part by China's move to discourage its purchase. It will be based on the company's Blackwell architecture, but will only be capable of half the computing power of NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Their regulatory and export approval aren't guaranteed, but the president previously implied that he was aware of the project and said he expects NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang to talk to him about it.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/china-reportedly-discouraged-purchase-of-nvidia-ai-chips-due-to-insulting-lutnick-statements-123055120.html?src=rss"}

Most often, they\u2019ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we\u2019ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you\u2019ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.</p> \n<p>If you\u2019re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You\u2019ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you\u2019re fine paying full price for it \u2014 that\u2019s the ideal situation. But if you\u2019re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apps/how-to-find-and-cancel-your-unused-subscriptions-130036314.html\">cancel</a> at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=fd7207b2-1b6a-4385-aa15-2f04784de078&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=026fe1b5-ea22-49f6-8016-fd8686928f5c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=DIRECTV&amp;linkText=DirecTV+starting+at+%2450%2Fmonth+for+one+month+%28%2435+off%29%3A&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXJlY3R2LmNvbS9hZmZpbGlhdGVzL3N0cmVhbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjAyNmZlMWI1LWVhMjItNDlmNi04MDE2LWZkODY4NjkyOGY1YyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlyZWN0di5jb20vYWZmaWxpYXRlcy9zdHJlYW0vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQDUQXWrENexJ0x2uVIRUR1ga53PuRSUUoWHof31tjmo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.directv.com%2Faffiliates%2Fstream%2F\"><strong>DirecTV starting at $50/month for one month ($35 off):</strong></a> All of DirecTV's signature packages are $35 off right now for your first month when you sign up.

These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you\u2019ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.</p> \n<p>Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9c431828-c2cf-402b-a23c-df7fba43d348&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=026fe1b5-ea22-49f6-8016-fd8686928f5c&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney+Store&amp;linkText=Disney%2B%2C+Hulu%2C+HBO+Max+bundle+with+ads+for+%2417%2Fmonth&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNuZXlwbHVzLmNvbS93ZWxjb21lL2Rpc25leS1odWx1LW1heC1idW5kbGUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjAyNmZlMWI1LWVhMjItNDlmNi04MDE2LWZkODY4NjkyOGY1YyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vd2VsY29tZS9kaXNuZXktaHVsdS1tYXgtYnVuZGxlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAduD_oqRyynLYkzWzDFLK1tpl2rJVpZNu-qVQ1XrfSaQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2Fdisney-hulu-max-bundle\"><strong>Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu.

British Airways is also on the verge of announcing a Starlink deal, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-21/musk-s-starlink-wi-fi-in-talks-with-emirates-saudia-flydubai\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reported, and SpaceX has also reportedly been in conversation with Dubai's Emirates. Both of those are flagship carriers in their respective nations, so winning the business would be a large coup for Starlink against legacy operators like Viasat and Echostar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Switching to Starlink isn't necessarily cheap, though. It reportedly costs around $300,000 to equip a 737 and around half a million to install the system on a 787 Dreamliner. On top of that, airlines pay around $120 monthly per seat, plus another $120 for live TV, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s sources. (None of the airlines in negotiations have confirmed any details.)</p>\n<p>Despite those costs, carriers see reliable in-flight internet as a potential game-changer, as it would allow customers to work, communicate and stream videos or live TV. If the latter can be done reliably, it might even allow airlines to get rid of heavy and expensive on-demand entertainment systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The main downside for potential customers is SpaceX's owner, Elon Musk. Some may view his fractured relationship with US president Donald Trump as a negative, while end-users may be turned off by his political affiliations \u2014 something that has <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-deliveries-drop-14-percent-amid-musk-backlash-141638753.html\">seemingly affected</a> sales of his Tesla EVs of late.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/alaska-air-will-offer-starlink-in-flight-internet-starting-next-year-120023852.html?src=rss"}

For now, the most recent MacBooks are the M4 MacBook Air and the M4 MacBook Pro. Deciding between just two models may seem easy, but there are still plenty of variables to consider before you add one to your cart \u2014 screen size, chip capabilities, price and memory configurations will all come into play. We\u2019ve reviewed every MacBook model to come out in the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2008-10-21-macbook-and-macbook-pro-review.html\">last 17 years or so</a>, so we compiled this guide to help you pick the best MacBook for you.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-best-macbooks-for-2025\">Best MacBooks for 2025</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-what-about-budget-macbooks\">What about budget MacBooks?</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-factors-to-consider-when-buying-a-macbook\">Factors to consider when buying a MacBook</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-best-macbooks-spec-comparison-chart\">MacBooks specs comparison chart</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-best-macbook-faqs\">Best MacBook FAQs</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-macbooks-for-2025\">Best MacBooks for 2025</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-about-budget-macbooks\">What about budget MacBooks?</h2> \n<p>Historically, Apple kept the previous year\u2019s MacBook Air in its lineup as a sort of budget option. But the company took a different approach with the release of the M4 MacBook Air. Instead of continuing to sell the older model, Apple discontinued the M3 Air and gave its newest computer a $100 price cut.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>Now, if you can even find a brand new M3 MacBook Air (typically from retailers like Amazon or B&amp;H), it\u2019s often more expensive than the M4 version. During sales like Amazon Prime Day, we\u2019ve seen the newest M4 Air go for as little as $799. That effectively makes our overall pick a budget pick as well.</p> \n<p>Of course, $800 isn\u2019t exactly a small investment either for college students or others on a budget. Especially when you can find some <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html\">decent PCs for under $500</a>.

There are a few guidelines to keep in mind, which we go <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/where-to-buy-refurbished-tech-140028700.html\">over in our refurbished guide</a>, but mainly, you\u2019ll want to shop from a reputable source that has a stated process and offers at least a year-long warranty. Using your old gear as a trade-in will bring down your final cost as well.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-factors-to-consider-when-buying-a-macbook\">Factors to consider when buying a MacBook</h2> \n<p>Compared to PCs, Apple computers tend to have more streamlined specifications. The company has long been known for this simplicity, and the M-series \u201csystem-on-a-chip\u201d condenses things even further. Prior to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-m1-mac-181040846.html\">M1</a> chip, Apple <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-arm-mac-processor-intel-182826202.html\">used Intel chips</a> in its laptop and desktop computers. The M2 and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apples-m3-chips-pro-max-003004080.html\">M3</a> generations followed that first chip and currently sells MacBooks equipped with M4-series chips. You\u2019ll find the standard M4 processor in the Air and the base-model Pro and the upgraded M4 Max and M4 Pro chips as options for the MacBook Pro (currently there is no M4 Ultra chip, as there was with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-new-mac-studio-comes-with-the-long-awaited-m3-ultra-chip-140005216.html\">M3 series</a> in the Mac Studio). All M-series chips combine, among other technologies, the CPU, graphics card and unified memory (RAM). Apple\u2019s Neural Engine is included too, which is a specialized group of processor cores that handles machine learning tasks such as image analysis and voice recognition.</p> \n<p>While a unified chip means you have fewer decisions to make when picking a MacBook, there are still a few factors to consider, including specs like the number of CPU cores, amount of RAM, storage capacity, screen size, and, obviously, price. The finish color may be a minor consideration, but it's worth pointing out that the Pro comes in just two colors (Silver or Space Black) but the Air comes in four hues (Midnight, Starlight, Sky Blue and Silver).</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-cpu-cores\"><strong>CPU cores</strong></h3> \n<p>The lowest-specced chip in a current-lineup MacBook is the standard M4 chip, which is found in all models of the MacBook Air and the base model MacBook Pro 14-inch. That chip houses a 10-core CPU and either an 8- or 10-core GPU. In total, there are three versions of the M4 chip: standard M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max (which are each a step up from their predecessors, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/new-report-reveals-details-on-the-three-m3-chips-apple-may-launch-monday-night-202456989.html\">M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max</a> chips). The burliest chip, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/apple-unveils-its-top-of-the-line-m4-max-chip-150241987.html\">M4 Max</a> is built with either a 14- or 16-core CPU and a 32- or 40-core GPU.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Cores are, in essence, smaller processing units that can handle different tasks simultaneously. Having more of them translates to the computer being able to run multiple programs and applications at once, while also smoothly processing demanding tasks like video and photo editing and high-level gaming. In short, more cores allow for more advanced computing and better performance. But if your processing power needs fall below professional-level gaming and cinematic video and audio editing, getting the highest number of cores is likely overkill \u2014 and after all, more cores equals higher cost and more power usage.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch from the rear, showing off the Apple logo.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-11/e536a1d0-7c1e-11ee-9e77-9ea8e142b078\" style=\"height: 1541px; width: 2500px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-ram\"><strong>RAM</strong></h3> \n<p>Your options for RAM, or in Apple\u2019s terminology, unified memory, varies, but with the switch to the M4 chip in all laptops, the lowest amount of RAM you can get is now 16GB. That\u2019s a necessary spec-bump to accommodate the tech world\u2019s favorite feature of the moment: AI or, in this case, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/the-imac-gets-an-m4-refresh-for-faster-apple-intelligence-151251449.html\">Apple Intelligence</a> (still AI, but Cupertino\u2019s version). The M4 Pro chip has 24 or 48GB memory options, while the M4 Max chip supports 48, 64 or a whopping 128GB of RAM.</p> \n<p>You\u2019ve likely heard the analogy comparing memory to the amount of workspace available on a literal desktop surface, whereas storage is the amount of drawers you have to store projects to work on later. The larger the worktop surface, the more projects you can work on at once. The bigger the drawers, the more you can save for later.</p> \n<p>In addition to supporting Apple Intelligence, more RAM is ideal for people who plan to work in multiple apps at once. And the more demanding each program is, the more RAM will be required. Extra memory can also come in handy if you\u2019re the type who likes to have infinite numbers of tabs open on your browser. If your daily workflow doesn\u2019t involve simultaneously using a vast number of memory-intensive programs, you can save yourself money and buy the RAM configuration that you\u2019re most likely to actually use.</p> \n<p>For a long time, Apple continued to offer MacBooks with just 8GB of RAM, and we recommended upgrading to at least 16GB of RAM. With this being the standard today, grabbing a base model should be fine for most non-pro-level users. One thing to note is that, unlike most PCs, the RAM in a MacBook is not user-upgradable since it\u2019s tied into the system-on-a-chip. If you think you might end up needing more memory, you should go for the spec upgrade up front.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-storage-capacity-ssd\"><strong>Storage capacity (SSD)</strong></h3> \n<p>Storage options range from 256GB of SSD for the base-model MacBook Air and 8TB of storage for the MacBook Pros with the M4 Max chip. If you want to rotate between a long roster of game titles or keep lots of high-res videos on hand, you\u2019ll want more storage. If you\u2019re mostly working with browser- and cloud-based applications, you can get away with a smaller-capacity configuration. That said, we recommend springing for 512GB of storage or more, if it\u2019s within your budget. You\u2019ll quickly feel the limits of a 256GB machine as it ages since the operating system alone takes up a good portion of that space. Having 1TB will feel even roomier and allow for more data storage over the life of your laptop.</p> \n<p>When Apple announced the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/iphone-15-pro-max-first-impressions-lights-camera-action-button-200647981.html\">iPhone 15</a>, the company also announced new iCloud+ <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/icloud-adds-new-6tb-and-12tb-storage-tiers-194853580.html\">storage storage plans</a>, with subscriptions that allow up to 12TB of storage shared among your iOS and MacOS devices. You could also transfer files to an external storage device. But if you don\u2019t want to pay for a monthly subscription and prefer the convenience of having immediate access to your files, it\u2019s best to get the highest amount of storage space your budget allows for at the outset.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-screen-size\"><strong>Screen size</strong></h3> \n<p>The MacBook Air comes in 13- or 15-inch sizes. Pro models have either 14- or 16-inch screens. A two-inch delta may not seem like much but, as Engadget\u2019s Nathan Ingraham noted when he <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-review-a-bigger-screen-makes-a-surprising-difference-130033172.html\">reviewed</a> the then-new 15-inch M2-powered MacBook Air, a larger screen \"makes a surprising difference.\u201d That\u2019s especially true if you plan to use your laptop as an all-day productivity machine and won\u2019t be using an external monitor. More space means you can more clearly view side-by-side windows and have a more immersive experience when watching shows or gaming.</p> \n<p>But screen size is one of the main factors influencing weight. The 13-inch MacBook Air M4 weighs 2.7 pounds, whereas the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro with the Max chip weighs 4.7 pounds. If you plan to travel a lot or swap your work locations regularly, a smaller screen will make life easier in the long run.</p> \n<p>All MacBooks feature IPS LCD panels (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-to-buy-a-monitor-143000069.html\">in-plane switching</a>, liquid crystal display), which Apple markets as Retina displays. The MacBook Air M4 has a Liquid Retina display and the Pro models have Liquid Retina XDR displays. \u201cLiquid\u201d refers to the way the lighted portion of the display \u201cflows\u201d within the contours of the screen, filling the rounded corners and curving around the camera notch. \u201cXDR\u201d is what Apple calls HDR (high dynamic range).</p> \n<p>You also get the option of a standard or nano-texture display on the MacBook Pro. The glass, which reduces glare and is also available on the Studio Display, iMac and iPad Pro, comes with a $150 price increase, but if you really don\u2019t like reflections on your screen, it could be worth it.</p> \n<p>Compared to most other laptops, MacBook displays are notably bright, sharp and lush. But one feature worth pointing out is another Apple marketing term: ProMotion. It\u2019s the company\u2019s term to describe a screen with a higher, 120Hz refresh rate, which results in smoother scrolling and more fluid-looking graphics. Only MacBook Pros offer ProMotion; the Air maxes out at 60Hz, which is perfectly fine for everyday browsing and typical workdays. But if you want buttery-smooth motion from your display, you\u2019ll have to shell out more money for an upgrade.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-operating-systems\"><strong>Operating systems</strong></h3> \n<p>Software considerations won\u2019t make much of a difference when deciding between MacBook models \u2014 all come with macOS installed. But <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/ask-engadget-is-it-a-good-time-to-move-to-macs-from-windows-145159396.html\">if you\u2019re switching</a> from, say, a Windows PC, the operating system may be something to factor into your decision \u2014 though it\u2019s probably less of an issue than it once was. Now that so much of the work we do on our computers is browser- and cloud-based, the learning curve between the two platforms isn\u2019t as steep. Apps and programs like Gmail perform similarly regardless of what computer you\u2019re using. Apple machines have historically had more limited support of AAA gaming titles, but even that is changing with more AAA games and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/metal-4-for-macos-tahoe-26-introduces-new-gaming-features-like-frame-interpolation-183247623.html\">better graphics</a> coming to Macs.</p> \n<p>As for macOS, it\u2019s getting better too. With <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-26-beta-preview-spotlights-time-to-shine-171700779.html\">macOS Tahoe 26</a>, the Spotlight function is more advanced, making it easier to find apps and perform tasks straight from your keyboard. The software also implements <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html\">Apple's unifying Liquid Glass design</a> for a modern look that looks consistent across iOS and iPad devices. New enhanced iPhone continuity features also make MacBooks and the handset work better together. A revamped Shortcuts app is more powerful as well, giving users custom automations that leverage Apple Intelligence (the company\u2019s own AI).</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-price\"><strong>Price</strong></h3> \n<p>When Apple announced the MacBook Air M4, it also delivered a bit of refreshing news: The latest model now starts $100 cheaper than the previous generation. So now, the least expensive MacBook is the 13-inch, M4-powered Air with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $999.

After years of silence around its sequel, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, Team Cherry has <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/theres-a-hollow-knight-silksong-livestream-on-august-21-at-1030am-et-153220026.html\">scheduled a livestream</a> with a \u201cspecial announcement\u201d about the game for August 21 at 10:30AM ET. Not only is this exciting for Metroidvania fans everywhere, but it\u2019s also possible that this announcement marks the final moments of the <em>Silksong</em> subreddit as we know it. A strange cocktail of game delays, inconsistent updates and hyper-focused cult fandom has cultivated a fascinating little universe in r/Silksong, complete with its own rules, villains and heroes. It\u2019s a place where clown wigs are commonplace and contributors have turned trolling into a role-playing artform. A LARPform, if you will. It\u2019s a place that\u2019s consistently made me laugh every time it\u2019s appeared in my feed over the past year or so.</p>\n<p>Ahead of Thursday\u2019s special announcement, this sub is experiencing the last gasps of desperate myth-making and hopeless anticipation before it transforms into something else entirely, armed with actual information about the sequel, gameplay videos and maybe even a firm release date. Or, dare I say it, a surprise launch. For just a moment longer in r/Silksong, anything is possible.</p>\n<p>And then it\u2019ll be over. No matter what happens during Thursday\u2019s livestream, the day will come when <em>Silksong</em> comes out and the drip-feed of silkposts dries up completely. But for now, our face paint is ready.

Alongside the release date, Microsoft announced the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-unveils-its-handheld-compatibility-program-162635781.html\">Handheld Compatibility Program</a>, an initiative aimed at optimizing games for portable devices and informing players about how well they perform.

Now, it\u2019s confirmed that PayPal has terminated its partnership with Steam in multiple countries, affecting any denomination \u201c<em>other than</em> EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD.\u201d</p>\n<p>Valve says it\u2019s being pressured by payment processors including Visa, MasterCard and PayPal to remove certain games and implement puritanical censorship policies, and this has already resulted in at least one game being <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/vile-exhumed-is-an-unjust-casualty-in-steams-sweeping-censorship-campaign-170203493.html\">unjustly removed</a> from the platform. That game, <em>VILE: Exhumed</em>, is now <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/banned-steam-game-vile-exhumed-is-back-as-a-free-shareware-title-225220847.html\">available as shareware</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-roblox-is-changing-its-rules-after-so-so-many-child-safety-lawsuits\"><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/roblox-cracks-down-on-its-user-created-content-following-multiple-child-safety-lawsuits-193452150.html\"><strong><em>Roblox</em></strong><strong> is changing its rules after so, so many child-safety lawsuits</strong></a></h3>\n<p><em>Roblox</em> is locking down its system for sharing and viewing user-generated games following <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-08-15/roblox-faces-lawsuits-over-child-safety\">a wave of lawsuits</a> accusing developers of failing to protect their young userbase. All unrated experiences, or user-created games, will be restricted to the developer and anyone actively working on them, rather than being available to anyone over the age of 13, as is currently the case. This change and others, including a new system that automatically detects and tracks &quot;violative scenes&quot; on individual servers, will roll out over the coming months.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-analogue-delayed-its-n64-remake-again\"><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-delays-its-n64-remake-console-yet-again-205343467.html\"><strong>Analogue delayed its N64 remake again</strong></a></h3>\n<p>It\u2019s now due out in Q4 2025. :(</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-additional-reading\"><strong>Additional reading</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-brilliant-puzzle-platformer-enter-the-gungeon-on-mobile-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110042847.html\">Kris Holt\u2019s indie game roundup</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/more-action-than-rpg-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-struggles-to-convince-after-a-few-hours-play\">More action than RPG, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 struggles to convince after a few hours' play</a> by Robert Purchese at <em>Eurogamer</em></p></li>\n</ul>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/video-games-weekly-silksong-and-gamescom-221635822.html?src=rss"}

It's been a very busy week in that realm, thanks to Gamescom. Before we jam through a few of this week's new releases and some of the many, many Gamescom reveals, there's one game that has risen high above the din to the point where it's drowning out many of the smaller announcements.</p>\n<p>Yes, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-out-on-september-4-143856097.html\"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>has a release date</a>, and it's very, very soon. September 4, in fact. I feel for all the developers who have games coming out around the same time, such as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cronos-the-new-dawn-seems-to-smush-dead-space-and-control-together-in-a-good-way-172611962.html\"><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em></a>, <em>Hell is Us,</em> <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/baby-steps-finally-has-a-release-date-two-years-after-it-was-originally-slated-to-arrive-214025574.html\"><em>Baby Steps</em></a> and even <em>NBA 2K26</em>. Sure, <em>Silksong </em>may primarily be for a different audience than the latest edition of a massive basketball franchise, but it's going to take up much of the oxygen in the gaming space for a while. As such, some developers are delaying their games to give <em>Silksong </em>a wide berth.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-brilliant-puzzle-platformer-enter-the-gungeon-on-mobile-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110042847.html\"><em>CloverPit</em></a> was scheduled to drop on September 3, but it's getting the hell out of <em>Silksong</em>'s way. The grimy, slot machine-based roguelike is now going to arrive on September 26. &quot;We like a gamble, but this one is too risky lol,&quot; developer Panik Arcade said. &quot;We want to give ourselves and our fans some time to enjoy <em>Silksong</em>, so we\u2019re launching a few weeks later and will use the time to polish <em>CloverPit </em>even further.&quot; Meanwhile, Talegames is pushing back the 1.0 release of its adventure RPG <em>Faeland </em>and Aeternum Game Studios is delaying a Metroidvania called <em>Aeterna Lucis </em>from September into 2026.</p>\n<p>There's no doubt that Silksong's arrival is a big deal. It's been the most wishlisted game on Steam for yonks, was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-gaming-devices-are-real-and-will-be-released-during-the-2025-holiday-season-142135533.html\">a focus</a> of Microsoft's Xbox Ally handheld reveal and is a sequel to an indie blockbuster that has now sold <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lww7wtl3js23\">more than 15 million copies</a>. In any case, we'll soon find out if that very, very long wait was worthwhile. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/video-games-weekly-silksong-and-gamescom-221635822.html\">Years of <em>Silksong </em>memes</a> sure were. I\u2019m going to need some other long-awaited game to joke about before every showcase now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-new-releases\">New releases</h2>\n<div id=\"11986698ccd34580a7d199558052d45a\"></div>\n<p>I have no earthly idea why it took me so long to try this, but I tested my PlayStation Portal by my building's pool for the first time this week and it turned out that the Wi-Fi was, in fact, strong enough there for me to use the handheld. It was a fitting place to check out <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/sword-of-the-sea-launches-august-19-120037636.html\"><em>Sword of the Sea</em></a>, which hit PS5 (including on PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium) and <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2453160/Sword_of_the_Sea/\">PC</a> this week.</p>\n<p>I'm only an hour or so into this $30 game from Giant Squid, but I'm enjoying the relaxed approach to exploration here. As you'd might expect from developers who have worked on <em>The Pathless</em>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-10-abzu-hands-on.html\"><em>Abzu</em></a> and <em>Journey</em>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/sword-of-the-sea-is-what-happens-when-matt-nava-strides-back-into-journeys-shadow-233148894.html\">the movement in <em>Sword of the Sea </em>is delightful</a>. You'll take off from wavy dunes and pull off tricks like you're in an SSX game as you surf across sand and water on a sword in the aim of restoring life to the barren landscape. <em>Sword of the Sea </em>is a looker, and I'll surely be getting lost in it some more over the coming days.</p>\n<div id=\"13e16af4131b446895bb50be39af28cb\"></div>\n<p>Speaking of games that have an eye-catching aesthetic, <em>Herdling </em>is another exploration and adventure title that dropped this week. This one's from Okomotive (<em>Far: Changing Tides, Far: Lone Sails</em>) and publisher Panic.</p>\n<p>Here, you'll be guiding a ragtag herd of beasts across hilly terrain toward the summit of a mountain. You'll have to solve some &quot;light&quot; environmental puzzles and even endure some stampedes along the way. <em>Herdling </em>typically costs $25, but there's a 25 percent launch discount. It's available on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3047750/Herdling/\">Steam</a>, <a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/herdling-2314b8\">Epic Games Store</a>, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. It's on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass too.</p>\n<div id=\"3f0407128d2a4f949677f6bf5f69052f\"></div>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-spellbinding-ball-x-pit-will-hit-pc-and-consoles-on-october-15-141156022.html\"><em>Ball x Pit</em></a> on the horizon, I figured we were all taken care of for the foreseeable future as far as <em>Breakout</em>-esque roguelites go. Not so fast, said the team behind <em>Vampire Survivors</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Poncle has spun up its own publishing arm and the second game it's releasing (after <em>Berserk or Die</em>) is <em>Kill the Brickman</em> from Doonutsaur. Poncle released the game on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3123120/Kill_the_Brickman/\">Steam</a> and Xbox without prior warning this week, and it costs five bucks.</p>\n<p>You'll collect and augment various bullets that you use to destroy bricks from outer space. There's a lot going on in the minute-long trailer, but I particularly love how some of the bricks &quot;cry&quot; when a bullet smacks into them.</p>\n<div id=\"70dd572309f141b3817e03e26293b8f7\"></div>\n<p><em>Discounty </em>is a life sim about managing a supermarket in a small town. Hopefully, you'll be a more magnanimous proprietor than the operators of the JoJa Mart in <em>Stardew Valley</em>, but you'll still have to deal with some folks who are none too pleased about the effect of the business on their town.</p>\n<p>Developer Crinkle Cut Games and publisher PQube suggest there are some secrets to discover in <em>Discounty</em>, which is out now on Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2274620/Discounty/\">Steam</a> and <a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/discounty-9a1cfd\">Epic Games Store</a>. It's coming to GOG as well at a later date. The game typically costs $20, though there's a 20 percent launch discount on PC.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-upcoming\">Upcoming</h2>\n<div id=\"c40935cb92fc4cab9676b984639096be\"></div>\n<p>Engadget senior reporter Igor Bonifacic spent a few hours with <em>Absolum</em>, a fantasy beat-'em-up with a roguelite spin from co-developers Guard Crush Games and Supamonk and publisher Dotemu (<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder\u2019s Revenge</em>, <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>). I highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/absolum-is-awesome-and-i-cant-wait-to-play-it-on-october-9-180037272.html\">reading his write up</a> for the full lowdown as <em>Absolum </em>sounds like a real treat.</p>\n<p>The demo for this slipped through the cracks for me during the early June chaos of Summer Game Fest and Steam Next Fest, but it's still available and I'll absolutely be checking it out to get a taste of <em>Absolum </em>before it arrives on October 4. It's coming to <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1904480/Absolum/\">Steam</a>, Nintendo Switch, PS4 and PS5.</p>\n<div id=\"4db0deb17f7c4c68b318be76dfb43ac5\"></div>\n<p>As I mentioned in our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/gamescom-2025-opening-night-live-updates-on-call-of-duty-resident-evil-and-more-new-game-reveals-100021985.html\">liveblog for Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> this week, any new Ron Gilbert game is worth getting excited about. He's the director of the first two Monkey Island games and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/return-to-monkey-island-ron-gilbert-teaser-trailer-155946148.html\"><em>Return to Monkey Island</em></a><em>,</em> as well as a developer and producer of so many other projects over the years. <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3773590/Death_By_Scrolling/\"><em>Death by Scrolling</em></a>. is something completely different for Gilbert.</p>\n<p>It's a vertical-scrolling, action-heavy roguelite in which you need to stay alive and earn enough gold to pay a toll to a ferryman to escape from the afterlife. The look is very heavily reminiscent of <em>Stardew</em>, so if plundering the mines in that game was more your jam than farming and fishing, this might be up your alley.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There's no release date as yet for <em>Death by Scrolling</em>, which Gilbert started working on back in 2019, but it's said to be coming this year. In the meantime, you can read updates about the game's development on <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://grumpygamer.com/\">Gilbert's terrific blog</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"ae25889f4b754f1eba6b3981f8f9d204\"></div>\n<p>It's fun that we had mentions of two John Carpenter-related projects at Gamescom this week. Not only was there another look at <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-brings-a-co-op-apocalypse-to-ps5-and-xbox-203721417.html\"><em>John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</em></a> during <em>Opening Night Live</em>, there was the reveal of <em>Halloween the Game </em>from IllFonic and co-publisher Gun Interactive.</p>\n<p>Set to arrive in 2026, <em>Halloween the Game </em>follows the likes of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/friday-the-13th-the-game-server-shutdown-204920014.html\"><em>Friday the 13th: The Game</em></a> (from the same teams) and the Gun-published <em>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.</em> It has a 1 vs. 4 asynchronous multiplayer mode in which the quartet will have to use anything at their disposal \u2014 from wielding weapons to calling the cops \u2014 to survive the threat of the unkillable Michael Myers. There's going to be a single-player aspect to this game as well, as you'll be able to control the legendary mass killer in an adaptation of the original film's story. <em>Halloween the Game </em>is coming to <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/concept/10014718\">PlayStation</a>, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=53aecda5-97a6-4b1e-85bc-12844a888f20&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;linkText=Xbox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RpZC85Tkw1TjIwUjA2RFYiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUzYWVjZGE1LTk3YTYtNGIxZS04NWJjLTEyODQ0YTg4OGYyMCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9zdG9yZS9wcm9kdWN0aWQvOU5MNU4yMFIwNkRWIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARE8DARB3f826e-tN26ji49LeDqnX4EqPDaP67WUdHz7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fstore%2Fproductid%2F9NL5N20R06DV\">Xbox</a>, <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219630/Halloween/\">Steam</a> and <a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/halloween-f3e2dd\">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"e088f25e4ac4440589a21bf470eb0c55\"></div>\n<p>A game about a guy with a brown backpack who scours ruined, overgrown suburban homes in search of valuable resources that can help him survive a bunch of zombies in the post-apocalypse? It has to be <em>Long Gone</em>, of course! What other game could you possibly be thinking of?</p>\n<p>This is a linear pixel-art narrative adventure from Hillfort Games and co-publisher Outersloth (<em>Among Us </em>studio Innersloth's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/innersloth-is-spending-all-its-among-us-money-on-indie-games-224010763.html\">publishing wing</a>). The developers seem to have been influenced by a little game you might have heard of called... <em>Gone Home</em>, as you'll look through the belongings of people who used to live in this world and learn the truth about what happened. There's no combat here. Instead, zombie encounters require puzzle solving. There's no release window as yet for this point-and-click game, which is coming to <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1977610/Long_Gone/\">Steam</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"f7ffcf946b7342778b927ed803b4e0a0\"></div>\n<p>Fittingly enough, I've had my eye on <em>Militsoner</em> for some time, so I was delighted to hear that there's a two-week playtest on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1373530/Militsioner/\">Steam</a> that's open to everyone. This is an immersive sim in which you'll try to escape a town, but that may not be too easy as there's an enormous policeman watching your every move. The playtest is limited to a slice of the town, but I'm really looking forward to getting in there and finding out what this is all about.</p>\n<div id=\"0b2663c1bc5d4f488dff93a0da891910\"></div>\n<p>I have to hold my hands up here and admit I'm not familiar with puzzle game maker Rusty Lake. But when the trailer for their next game popped up this week, it had me utterly captivated, because <em>Servant of the Lake </em>looks very, very pretty.</p>\n<p>This is a point-and-click puzzle adventure that will see you carrying out tasks as seemingly innocuous as straightening picture frames to helping with experiments and cleaning up afterward. You'll play as a housekeeper of an estate, but it's not entirely clear whether you'll be able to survive the weekend... <em>Servant of the Lake </em>is coming to <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3636770/Servant_of_the_Lake/\">Steam</a>, Itch.io, iOS and Android in Spring 2026.</p>\n<div id=\"76b2aeeb821d43d58af5de4264f8b2bf\"></div>\n<p><em>BPM: Bullets Per Minute</em> developer Awe Interactive is back with another rhythm-based shooter, albeit one that has a top-down perspective instead of a first-person one. <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3448070/BPM_Bitcrushed/\"><em>BPM Bitcrushed</em></a> (which is being published by Kwalee) is a roguelite, pixel art dungeon crawler that syncs shooting, jumping and dodging to the beat. The dungeons are procedurally generated and there's a &quot;wide variety of powerful weapons, unique items and rhythm-based abilities&quot; to discover.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What's most interesting to me here though is that, along with the game's own soundtrack, you can load in your own tunes via the custom music feature. Perhaps setting the action to some slow-tempo sludge metal will make things a bit easier.</p>\n<div id=\"882907520f994fba9bdab34a373baa65\"></div>\n<p><em>Couch Planes </em>is an arcade plane racer from Skylab Interactive that's coming to <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2431740/Couch_Planes/\">Steam</a>, <a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/couch-planes-08f78a\">Epic Games Store</a> and consoles next year. There are a few different modes, 15 maps with environmental hazards and collectable power ups including homing rockets, mines and speed boosts. There's support for four-person local multiplayer and 12-player online action.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From <em>Starfox </em>and <em>Grand Theft Auto V </em>to <em>The Falconeer</em> and <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em>, I've never been much good at flying in games. But hey, <em>Couch Planes </em>looks like it could be a fun time with friends.</p>\n<div id=\"5361decf9f9c4fdab99668d6d869a802\"></div>\n<p>Let's close out this bumper post-Gamescom edition of our indie games roundup with something that might not be for me, but could be for you. <em>Canvas City </em>is the first project from Disc 2 Games, which is self-publishing the game with help from <em>Dredge </em>studio Black Salt Games.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Turn-based tactics games aren't typically my jam, but I'm always going to have at least some interest in one that's about a group of upstarts rebelling against an oppressive force. In this case, you'll take charge of skaters and street artists who are fighting back in a &quot;vibrant yet suppressed urban world&quot; (which sounds a little similar to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-rhythm-infused-adventure-unbeatable-has-a-new-demo-for-pc-and-ps5-185618354.html\"><em>Unbeatable</em></a>, which this week got a November 6 release date).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What caught my attention here is that fluid movement is a key part of the game. When it's your turn, you can use rails, ramps and other parts of the environment to pull off combinations of tricks and attacks. These chained actions can also earn you Style Points that can enhance your abilities.</p>\n<p>Disc 2 hasn't revealed a release window for <em>Canvas City</em> as yet. It's in development for <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3226830/Canvas_City/\">Steam</a> and Nintendo Switch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/surfing-sand-and-sea-herding-beasts-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110053175.html?src=rss"}

She urged Trump to send a letter to Netanyahu containing \u201ca strong call to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza\u201d, describing such a step as a \"historic responsibility\".</p>\n\n<p>She concluded by stating that children in both Ukraine and Palestine deserve the same rights to safety, joy and a secure future.</p>\n</div>\n      \n  </div>\n\n</article>"}

href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/palestine\">Palestinian</a> group accepted its conditions, Israel's Channel 13 investigative programme HaMakor reported on Friday.</p>\n\n<p>According to senior <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us\">American</a> and Israeli officials interviewed by the programme, Israel blocked a ceasefire agreement on seven occasions during nearly two years of its devastating military campaign against the besieged enclave.</p>\n\n<p>The officials said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was chiefly responsible, often bowing to pressure from far-right ministers, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir.</p>\n\n<p>Matthew Miller, spokesperson for the US State Department under President Joe Biden, said that at the start of the war in October 2023, Hamas was ready to release \"some hostages\".</p>\n\n<p>\"We have been trying to get through to the government of Israel to tell them that,\" Miller said, but added that Washington could not \"get anyone in there to take us seriously\",&nbsp;referring to the Israeli leadership.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n

Gallant, Israel's defence minister at the time, told HaMakor&nbsp;that he had instructed his subordinates: \"No one is talking to Hamas\",&nbsp;adding that he wanted the group to \"come to us\" after the Israeli army \"put their heads under the water\" so \"they won't be able to breathe\".</p>\n\n<p dir=\"LTR\">Gadi Eisenkot, who served on the War Cabinet, said the government initially made no effort to secure the captives' release, noting that \"in the war's goals, there is not a single word about the captives and their return\".&nbsp;He added that the first ceasefire in November 2023 came after&nbsp;Netanyahu and Gallant piled up obstacles.</p>\n\n<p>Eisenkot said&nbsp;the deal could have been extended, but the Israeli government refused to move forward unless Hamas committed to releasing the remaining women captives.</p>\n\n<p>\"We could have brought back seriously wounded and elderly people alive, who unfortunately were later murdered or killed,\" he added.</p><div

but sources involved in the negotiations told Channel 13 that the government refused Hamas's demand to allow displaced Palestinians to return to the northern part of the Gaza Strip.</p>\n\n<p>Miller said Israel accepted a US proposal in April 2024, shortly before the ground invasion of the southern city of Rafah, for a six-week ceasefire. The plan did not require Israel to end the war but was intended to halt a military operation in Rafah. Netanyahu's insistence that Israel would invade the city regardless, however, complicated the talks.</p>\n\n<p>\"You can imagine how much harder it made it to get a deal over the line.

It is such an inscription of power on babies' flesh, as on the Palestinian flesh of men and women, old and young, that I ontologically link their slowly dying bodies to the settler-colonial state.</p>\n\n<h3>A colonial prism</h3>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=frantz+fanon+middle+east+eye&amp;client=safari&amp;sca_esv=75973f5d98028357&amp;channel=mac_bm&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifNsB8kVXKBlE3oRUE-je6EQtyGRyg%3A1755785176140&amp;source=hp&amp;ei=2CenaPHwBYitkdUP-86I0QM&amp;iflsig=AOw8s4IAAAAAaKc16F3IkiCR21Tvq5mCCce8ny-gOZwM&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxvOS9iZyPAxWIVqQEHXsnIjoQ4dUDCBo&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=frantz+fanon+middle+east+eye&amp;gs_lp=Egdnd3Mtd2l6IhxmcmFudHogZmFub24gbWlkZGxlIGVhc3QgZXllMggQABiABBiiBDIIEAAYgAQYogQyCBAAGIAEGKIEMgUQABjvBUisOFAAWI82cAJ4AJABAJgBiQGgAaMUqgEEMjYuNLgBA8gBAPgBAZgCIKAC4hXCAgQQIxgnwgIKECMYgAQYJxiKBcICCxAAGIAEGJECGIoFwgIREC4YgAQYsQMY0QMYgwEYxwHCAg4QLhiABBixAxiDARiKBcICDhAAGIAEGLEDGIMBGIoFwgILEAAYgAQYsQMYgwHCAgQQABgDwgIIEC4YgAQYsQPCAgoQABiABBhDGIoFwgIQEC4YgAQYQxjHARiKBRivAcICDRAuGIAEGLEDGEMYigXCAggQABiABBixA8ICCxAuGIAEGJECGIoFwgIKEC4YgAQYQxiKBcICExAAGIAEGJECGLEDGIoFGEYY-QHCAg0QABiABBixAxhDGIoFwgIQEAAYgAQYsQMYQxiDARiKBcICExAuGIAEGLEDGEMYgwEY1AIYigXCAg4QLhiABBjUAhjHARivAcICBRAAGIAEwgIFEC4YgATCAgsQLhiABBjHARivAcICCBAuGIAEGNQCwgIKEAAYgAQYFBiHAsICBhAAGBYYHsICCBAAGBYYChgewgILEAAYgAQYhgMYigXCAgUQIRigAcICBxAhGKABGAqYAwCSBwQyNi42oAez8gGyBwQyNC42uAfbFcIHCDEuOC4yMS4yyAeNAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz\">Frantz Fanon</a> has explained, the notion of ontological difference involves seeing below the notion of being, and even below the notion of nonbeing, hence his insistence on talking about the colonised and the tensions that emerge in the flesh/land and, I would say, the cut, scattered, burned flesh and bones. Seen through the prism of the incomprehensible ashlaa', the racialised being, voided of life, is deprived of their humanity and Palestinian unwholeness is maintained and extended.</p>\n\n<p>The violent horrors we are seeing in Gaza over the past 20 months have made us witnesses to the strangulation of newborn babies, a strangulation that demands their submission to the occupying power. What we have witnessed through these horrors is part of the<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel\"> Israeli </a>necropenological global and local regime.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    \n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live/live-54-palestinians-killed-831-wounded-24-hours\">Follow Middle East Eye's live coverage of the Israel-Palestine war</a></strong></em></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>We witnessed another glimpse just recently this month through the intentional <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/palestinians-starvation-gaza-humanitarian-theatre-not-intervention\">starvation of Palestinian children</a> and their communities by Israeli expansionist greed.</p>\n\n<p>Another blatant example of Israel's necropenological regime happened on 5 May, when a group of Israeli soldiers <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2025/5/5/israeli-soldiers-blow-up-building-in-gaza-for-gender-reveal-party\">filmed </a>themselves blowing up a building in Gaza, while laughing that the blue colour of the smoke represented a \"gender reveal\" to celebrate the birth of a baby boy.</p>\n\n<p>This horrific act of celebration came as the Israeli army was abandoning newborns in&nbsp;incubators, and bombing entire families while at home or in their tents, in hospitals, while care-taking. The indiscriminate assassinations of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jul/02/shock-and-grief-as-senior-doctor-killed-in-israeli-airstrike-in-gaza\">doctors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ceqyyrp3yq9o\">journalists</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/04/un-experts-deeply-concerned-over-scholasticide-gaza\">educators</a> and more reveals the hunger for unending Palestinian death.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The indiscriminate assassinations of doctors, journalists, educators and more reveals the hunger for unending&nbsp;Palestinian death</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is from the silent voices of those shredded newborn babies as ashlaa', and through the necropolitical brutality of the \"gender reveal\" using the Palestinian ashlaa', that I read the brutality of the occupier. It is against this deadly enfleshed ontology, and the centrality of death in this ontology, that I read the scattered body parts - the ashlaa' <em>-&nbsp;</em>the decomposed babies' overwhelming presence as a strong voice to guide my analyses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>My ontological analysis is guided through the figurative occupation and possession of the decomposed Palestinian body. It is on this body that we can read the Zionist wanton use of violence to understand the centrality of death, killing and overkilling to the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/gaza-genocide-risks-becoming-model-muslims-targeted-globally\">settler-colonial project</a>. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The emotions of pleasure and joy expressed by the Israeli soldiers during the \"gender reveal\" in May that I just mentioned, expresses the Zionist coloniser's ideology. This ideology rejoices over Palestinian maiming, death and suffering. As they literally blew up Palestinians' bodies, the soldiers celebrated by chanting \"it is a boy\".</p>\n\n<p>What does this suggest about Zionist ideology, that soldiers can and do celebrate in the exact moments they destroy the colonised's geography and home? This convergence of violence and pleasure so spectacularly live-streamed, demonstrated through the gender reveal/bombing with its monstrosity, exposes the local and global ontological politics and dilemmas facing genocide studies today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Commitment to violence&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>Palestinian dispossession and death as a result of Zionism reveals a genocidal economy - an economy embedded in white supremacy/racism that dispossesses Palestinian humanity, even the newborn babies, with its codes, technologies, aesthetics and visuality. This is what enables the ongoing genocide and/in its ontological consumption.</p>\n\n<p>The genocidal economy is constituted through the enmeshment of ashlaa'<em>&nbsp;</em>and the viscerality of it, living in such a scale of death and the geopolitics of racism. It is rooted in the colonial state's commitment to violence, and its exercise of power over the non-human, always killable Palestinian body - an ontological stand that can be detected in all aspects of the settler-colonial genocidal criminalities of the state.</p>\n\n<div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-opinion mee-readmore-type-image align-right\">\n  <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/how-murder-al-jazeera-journalists-part-israels-gaza-occupation-strategy\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/palestine-gaza-city-grave-anas-al-sharif-august-2025-bashar-taleb-afp.jpg.webp?itok=84pQwbmt\" width=\"400\" />\n\n</a>  <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">How murder of Al Jazeera journalists is part of Israel's Gaza occupation strategy</div>\n    <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/how-murder-al-jazeera-journalists-part-israels-gaza-occupation-strategy\">Read More \u00bb</a>\n</div>\n\n<p>Under such conditions, Palestinian ashlaa'&nbsp;becomes more visible in the settler state's infinite desire for expansion, even over shredded or sick bodies, empty stomachs and collective graves.

It has turned Gaza/Palestine into a collective graveyard for slow and fast death, a slaughterhouse&nbsp;of maiming and wounding for the political functioning of the state - and hence the continuous Nakba.</p>\n\n<p>I stand against the settler-colonial assertion of turning the Palestinian body/flesh, geography and economy into a death zone. This stand grounds my analysis as a criminologist and scholar. My imperative is not the legal apparatus, nor the human right conventions, but rather human life, dignity, integrity and futurity of the people. I also do not believe in the system of the state, or the \"security of the state\".

In the UK, it's only required to check for a user's age if they're accessing certain content and features. In Mississippi, however, it cannot allow anyone to access its service at all, unless they hand over sensitive data proving how old they are. Further, the platform will be required to keep track of which users are children under 18, and it will be responsible for making sure those users won't be able to access &quot;harmful materials.&quot; Earlier this month, the Supreme Court decided <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/the-supreme-court-lets-mississippis-social-media-age-verification-law-go-into-effect-231405142.html\">not to intervene</a> with the legislation, allowing it to go into effect.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The service says that it doesn't have the significant resources needed to be able to build the required &quot;verification systems, parental consent workflows and compliance infrastructure.&quot; In addition, it could be penalized with up $10,000 per user if the government finds it to be non-compliant. Because only big tech companies can afford the costs associated with those requirements, Bluesky says the &quot;dynamic entrenches existing big tech platforms while stifling the innovation and competition that benefits users.&quot;</p>\n<p>Bluesky will now show a note to any user accessing the service from Mississippi, telling them why it's no longer available in the state.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/bluesky-blocks-mississippi-due-to-its-new-age-verification-law-133049512.html?src=rss"}

Local authorities have granted the company the permit needed to be able to test autonomous vehicles in parts of Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn. It's the first-ever permit for the &quot;testing deployment&quot; of AVs the city has granted. Waymo will be able to deploy a fleet with up to eight vehicles in the city until late September 2025.

One of the more charming peripherals, the HORI Piranha Plant camera, is on sale right now for only $40. That's $20 off and a record-low price. It's a good deal for anyone who wants to take advantage of the Switch 2's camera functionality in games like <em>Mario Kart World</em> and that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/chillin-by-the-fire-is-a-relaxing-co-op-campfire-sim-thats-out-today-on-nintendo-switch-2-150009762.html\">recently-released campfire sim</a>.</p> \n<p>This was designed specifically for Nintendo's new console, so it's a plug-and-play affair. It's actually cheaper than the official Switch 2 camera with this sale and it looks a whole lot cooler. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise. We called it a \"work of art\" <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/horis-piranha-plant-switch-2-camera-is-a-work-of-art-194430377.html\">upon encountering the device</a> and that holds true today.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p> </p> \n<p>This thing is not only stylish, resembling an Amiibo more than a camera, but it's downright useful. The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console.</p> \n<p>There's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p.

They were not successful.\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Kenneth Roth, an American attorney who was executive director of Human Rights Watch for nearly three decades, said Sebutinde\u2019s comments suggest \u201cshe does not have the dispassionate attitude in the case of Israel that judges are supposed to have\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSebutinde\u2019s comments suggest that her own beliefs may make her incapable of objectively assessing Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza, in which case she should recuse herself from the proceedings,\u201d he told MEE.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Becker noted that the ICJ already had critics who see the court as ineffectual and politicised.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe ICJ is understandably very reluctant to force a judge not to sit in a particular case, in part because of the Court\u2019s strong tradition of collegiality,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>He said that while judges recused themselves from cases regularly, he was not aware of any case where the recusal was as a result of pressure from the ICJ president or a party to a case.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDespite the fact that Judge Sebutinde\u2019s comments appear to have been deeply inappropriate, the best course for the Court in this case may be to do nothing,\u201d Becker said. \u201cRather than opening itself up to the bad faith accusations of bias that might then be directed against other judges.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Vasiliev said that Sebutinde\u2019s comments may not cause formal consequences, but will instead cause reputational damage - both to the weight of the Ugandan judge\u2019s contributions in the relevant cases, as well as to the ICJ as a whole.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is not the kind of attention that the Court (or any other international bench) needs,\u201d&nbsp; he said. \u201cThis is unfortunate and, to my knowledge, unprecedented at the ICJ.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-icj-case\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel ICJ case</a></div>\n            <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\">\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n          </div>\n              <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div>\n        <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\">\n    <div>Post Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\">\n    <div>Update Date</div>\n              <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\">\n    <div>Update Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n\n  </div>\n  \n</article>"}

The whole world was against Israel, including my country.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>She went on to say that she had a strong conviction that \u201cwe are in the end times\u201d, and that the situation in the Middle East was&nbsp;among the signs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI want to be on the right side of history. I am convinced that time is running out,\u201d she added.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>'Unusual and objectionable'</h3>\n\n<p>&nbsp;The unusual step to speak publicly about her support for Israel has come under the spotlight, particularly from legal experts.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is never a good idea for an ICJ judge to share their own views on a pending case in a public forum,\u201d Michael Becker, a professor of law and former associate legal officer at the ICJ, told MEE.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    \n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is worse to suggest that your position is to be \u2018on the side\u2019 of a specific party to the case.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>'Article 38 of the ICJ statute, which sets out the relevant sources of international law, does not encompass the word of God'</p>\n\n<p><em>- Michael Becker, law&nbsp;professor&nbsp;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When sworn in, all ICJ judges take an oath committing to exercising their powers \u201cimpartially and conscientiously\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Becker noted that strong religious convictions are not the problem.&nbsp;He said that a judge\u2019s sense of morality or justice, which could be driven by religion, can sometimes inform the proper exercise of judicial discretion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBut law creates guardrails and requires judges to justify decisions within the terms of the law, drawing upon recognised sources of law,\u201d Becker said.&nbsp;\u201cArticle 38 of the ICJ statute, which sets out the relevant sources of international law, most certainly does not encompass the word of God.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sergev Vasiliev, an international law scholar, said it was both unusual and \u201cobjectionable\u201d that Sebutinde spoke about the cases outside the arena of official concurring or dissenting opinions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSuch interventions risk creating an impression of (or showing) bias and raise inevitable questions about their ability to adjudicate impartially,\u201d he told MEE.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Vasiliev added that not only must a judge act impartially, but they must appear to do so in the eyes of a \u201creasonable observer\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHowever \u2018conscientious\u2019 her decisions may have been, Judge Sebutinde\u2019s statement that it is her divine duty to stand with Israel - a respondent state in pending contentious proceedings - calls her impartiality into question,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is hard to see how a reasonable observer could conclude otherwise.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Plagiarism allegations</h3>\n\n<p>Sebutinde\u2019s dissenting opinion on Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestine already came under severe criticism earlier this year over plagiarism allegations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A 15-judge panel found that Israel's decades-long occupation of the Palestinian territories was \"unlawful\" and that its \"near-complete separation\" of people in the occupied West Bank breached international laws concerning \"racial segregation\" and \"apartheid\".&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    \n<!-- responsive -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper \" style=\"display: block;\"></ins>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>While most judges agreed with the advisory opinion, Sebutinde rejected the findings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\">\n  <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/icj-president-julia-sebutinde-alleged-plagiarism-israel-occupation-damage-court\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"mee-readmore-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/julia-sebutinde-afp.jpg.webp?itok=Eqycd6_E\" width=\"400\" />\n\n</a>  <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">ICJ president\u2019s plagiarism in Israel opinion \u2018reflects poorly\u2019, experts say</div>\n    <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/icj-president-julia-sebutinde-alleged-plagiarism-israel-occupation-damage-court\">Read More \u00bb</a>\n</div>\n\n<p>She was later <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/icj-president-accused-plagiarism-dissenting-opinion-israeli-occupation\">accused of directly lifting sentences</a> almost word for word in her <a href=\"https://icj-cij.org/node/204162\">dissenting opinion</a> written on 19 July 2024, including from pro-Israel sources, a column written by a former US official, as well as from Wikipedia and the BBC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A study seen by Middle East Eye, done by a Palestinian researcher for an upcoming book by American scholar Norman Finkelstein,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/fresh-allegations-emerge-plagiarism-icj-president-israel-opinion\">alleged</a> that \u201cat least 32 percent of Sebutinde\u2019s dissent was plagiarised\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIn light of the plagiarism accusations, Judge Sebutinde\u2019s reported comments will add to the perception that she is determined to reach certain outcomes, regardless of the law or the factual evidence before the Court,\u201d Becker said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Vasiliev noted that Sebutinde\u2019s views, when expressed within her judgement, had already sparked controversy \u201cbecause of credible allegations of plagiarism and reliance on sources of questionable quality and admissibility\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHer remarks at Watoto Church place the dissents in a broader ideological frame, reinforcing perceptions of bias,\u201d he added.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Will there be consequences?</h3>\n\n<p>Juliette McIntyre, a lecturer in law at the University of South Australia, noted that pre-deciding which party to favour potentially violated the oath taken pursuant to Article 20 of the ICJ\u2019s statute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is possible that the Court will pursue measures for her recusal, pursuant to Article 24,\u201d McIntyre, whose doctoral research focuses on ICJ rules and procedures, told MEE.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>She added that the ICJ\u2019s president, currently Yuji Iwasawa, could ask for a member of the court not to sit on a particular case if it was deemed necessary for some special reason.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>'Such interventions risk creating an impression of bias and raise inevitable questions about their ability to adjudicate impartially'</p>\n\n<p><em>-&nbsp;Sergev Vasiliev, international law scholar</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If that judge refuses to step aside, the matter can be settled by a decision made by the court.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cJudges may also excuse themselves from a case because of a potential conflict of interest or lack of impartiality,\u201d said McIntyre.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>She added that Article 48 empowers the court to make orders for the conduct of the case, which can include complaints made by one party regarding the participation of a specific judge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis happened in the Namibia Advisory Opinion, where South Africa sought the removal of Judge Zafrulla Khan for allegedly being \u2018biased\u2019 against South Africa. They were not successful,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Kenneth Roth, an American attorney who was executive director of Human Rights Watch for nearly three decades, said Sebutinde\u2019s comments suggest \u201cshe does not have the dispassionate attitude in the case of Israel that judges are supposed to have\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSebutinde\u2019s comments suggest that her own beliefs may make her incapable of objectively assessing Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza, in which case she should recuse herself from the proceedings,\u201d he told MEE.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Becker noted that the ICJ already had critics who see the court as ineffectual and politicised.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe ICJ is understandably very reluctant to force a judge not to sit in a particular case, in part because of the Court\u2019s strong tradition of collegiality,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>He said that while judges recused themselves from cases regularly, he was not aware of any case where the recusal was as a result of pressure from the ICJ president or a party to a case.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDespite the fact that Judge Sebutinde\u2019s comments appear to have been deeply inappropriate, the best course for the Court in this case may be to do nothing,\u201d Becker said. \u201cRather than opening itself up to the bad faith accusations of bias that might then be directed against other judges.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Vasiliev said that Sebutinde\u2019s comments may not cause formal consequences, but will instead cause reputational damage - both to the weight of the Ugandan judge\u2019s contributions in the relevant cases, as well as to the ICJ as a whole.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is not the kind of attention that the Court (or any other international bench) needs,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is unfortunate and, to my knowledge, unprecedented at the ICJ.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-icj-case\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel ICJ case</a></div>\n            <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\">\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n          </div>\n              <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div>\n        <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\">\n    <div>Post Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\">\n    <div>Update Date</div>\n              <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\">\n    <div>Update Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n\n  </div>\n  \n</article>"}

We praised the unit <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ooni-volt-12-review-180019262.html\">in our official review</a>, saying that it \"works just as well\" as the company's indoor models. It preheats quickly and the interior is spacious. It can hit 850 degrees, which cooks a pizza in 90 seconds.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p> </p> \n<p>The oven also requires little-to-no supervision during use. It's pretty much a set it and forget it type appliance. This operates in stark contrast with the company's outdoor models, which demands that folks pay attention to the fire during use.</p> \n<p>The Volt 12 made our list of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-pizza-oven-141550352.html\">best pizza ovens</a>, and it's absolutely the finest indoor model available right now. The only major downside is the price. It's tough to recommend any indoor kitchen doodad at $900, but it's easier to do so at $629.</p> \n<p>This isn't the only interesting item on sale right now at Ooni.
